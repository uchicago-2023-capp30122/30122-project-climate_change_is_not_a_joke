People's Republic of China,East Asia,Development of an Innovative Regulatory Approach for the Pillar III Pension System Amid Population Aging,"The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will provide the China Institute of Finance and Capital Markets (CIFCM) with technical support and institutional capacity to prepare a framework of capital market and investment regulations that will underpin the Pillar III pension scheme in the People's Republic of China (PRC). A pension system requires three pillars. Pillar I is a country's national pension scheme that ensures basic social protection to all citizens. Pillar II provides additional protection for some formally employed citizens, particularly those in the public sector and in urban centers. Pillar III pension plans give individual citizens further protection through more tailored, market-based options. Given the rapid aging of its population, the PRC's Pillar I, first formalized in 1991, will become unsustainable. Pillar II, established in 2008, covers only about 5% of the population. The first two pillars leave a substantial coverage gap, while Pillar III has not yet been established in the PRC. The TA team will therefore help prepare a framework of capital market and investment regulations that is central to the development of Pillar III.An improved pension system is aligned with priority 3---aging society and health security---of the PRC country partnership strategy since it enables broad-based social protection coverage. In addition, by supporting an advanced market-based individual pension scheme and the underlying capital market system, the TA deliverables will also help enhance regional cooperation and integration through knowledge development, regional learning, and investment initiatives. Specifically, the TA's role in helping design market-based pension investment products and a regulatory framework will be illuminating for other developing member countries of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).

Regional,Regional,Research on Economic Resilience,"The proposed TA will conduct research studies to understand how economies can better achieve economic resilience. Building on the analytical framework of Park, Ramayandi, and Shin (2015), it will explore the determinants of economic resilience at the country level and identify those factors that have the biggest role in resilience in the face of shocks. It will uncover why some economies are more resilient than others. It is also important to understand if the determinants of resilience differ for various types of shocks. For instance, do they differ for financial shocks, real sector shocks, and pandemics? In addition, there are major shocks that affect many developing member countries (DMCs) emanating from natural disasters, especially those due to climate change, and the resilience of economies is expected to vary for such type of shocks. It is therefore necessary to include an analysis of these shocks under the TA. At the firm level, there is a need to examine why some businesses are able to withstand shocks better than others, and why some firms even thrive during shocks while others struggle to keep afloat. There are also economic shocks that have occurred due to dependence on foreign sources for supply, and this particularly applies to energy. For example, the Russian invasion of Ukraine adversely affected energy supplies, thus raising the costs of imported energy and triggering inflationary pressures. The TA will also include an analysis of the key drivers of energy efficiency and renewable energy investment, which can help reduce vulnerability to shocks from reliance to external sources. Overall, government policies have a key role to play in building resilience against shocks,. There is a need to identify concrete macroeconomic policies, financial-sector policies, and structural policies that governments can put in to place to boost resilience.",Active,http://www.adb.org/projects/55256-002/main,28 Sep 2022,120000.0,1,2022,Energy,No

The overall TA cluster amount is $3.88 million, out of which $3.73 million is financed on a grant basis from the Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and $0.15 million from the Climate Change Fund. The Environment, Natural Resources, and Agriculture Division of ADB's East Asia Department is responsible for administration and coordination of the TA cluster. The National Development and Reform Commission, the leading agency for strategic development in the People's Republic of China (PRC), is the executing agency for the TA cluster to play a leading role to support knowledge sharing and coordinate with ADB for alignment of ADB lending and nonlending assistance in the Yellow River basin.The TA cluster comprises a total of 13 subprojects, each focused on different aspects of river basin management. Ten subprojects are under implementation and three are under preparation. The TA cluster is part of ADB's Yellow River Ecological Corridor (YREC) program, a multisector approach which is aligned with the following impact: resilient ecological protection and security in the Yellow River basin achieved. The TA cluster and YREC program are supporting the PRC's Yellow River Basin Ecological Protection and High-quality Development Program, 20212035, which aims to strengthen water resources management and sustainable development in the basin. Subproject context. Identifying the ecological water requirements of rivers is essential to maintaining river health. The lower reaches of the Yellow River are located within two provinces of the PRC, Henan and Shandong, and support freshwater and estuarine wetlands, agricultural lands, and rural and urban development. The river drains into a large, branching estuarine delta. The lower Yellow River and delta support the livelihoods of millions of people and globally important freshwater and marine biodiversity values. The continued maintenance of these values is largely dependent upon upstream flow and sediment inputs and are at risk from altered flows and water shortages, caused by multiple factors including excessive water extraction, dams and flow regulation, and climate change. Regulation of water use in the Yellow River is managed through a framework of national and provincial policies, but which requires supporting data to help ensure adequate flow allocation for different needs. There is a need to identify the ecological water requirements of the lower Yellow River and to develop technical and policy measures to achieve ecological water security in a balanced approach that considers multisector water needs.Two subprojects under implementation in the TA cluster are partly addressing these issues. Under subproject 1, a basin-wide water resources profile is under preparation, to document existing water demand, supply, allocation and regulation for multiple sectors and strategies and actions to strengthen water resources management. Under subproject 9, a biodiversity strategy and action plan is under preparation for the portion of the Yellow River basin within Henan Province, and which includes a preliminary review of environmental flows. These works build upon long-term efforts by the government to strengthen water resources management of the Yellow River basin.",Active,http://www.adb.org/projects/54026-013/main,22 Oct 2022,300000.0,1,2022,"Agriculture, natural resources and rural development",Yes

Recognizing these risks, the government has developed an ambitious reform agenda comprising critical policy reforms to, among others: develop an overarching fiscal responsibility legislation and a corresponding medium-term fiscal strategy; implement a comprehensive tax reform package to modernize and increase the efficiency of Palau's tax system; and strengthen the legal and institutional frameworks for international commercial arbitration, public-private partnerships, and business registrations.

The eruption produced an ash cloud that rose 30 kilometers (km) in altitude, launched an estimated 1 cubic kilometer of material into the atmosphere, and triggered a tsunami which resulted in inundation in Tonga and affected other countries, with waves recorded as far away as Japan, Peru, and the United States.An estimated 85,000 people (84% of the population) were directly affected. Tsunami waves affected the west coast of Tongatapu (the main island), the island of 'Eua, and the Ha'apai group of islands, travelling up to 200 meters inland. The Government of Tonga reported three confirmed fatalities. The islands of 'Atata, Mango, Fonoifua, and Nomuka were the worst affected with all but the largest buildings destroyed, leaving widespread debris. The populations of these islands were evacuated to other islands where evacuation shelters were established. Government reported 293 houses across Tonga were damaged or destroyed and over 1,500 persons were displaced. Ashfall, measuring between 5-10 centimeters thick on Tongatapu, impacted all island groups, resulting in defoliated trees, buried crops, damaged public infrastructure and houses, and contaminated water supplies. These impacts led to food and water insecurity.The government declared a state of emergency commencing 16 January 2022, pursuant to section 32 of the Emergency Management Act. The National Emergency Management Office coordinated and monitored relief efforts by government agencies, and local and international nongovernmental organizations.

Due to the large distances, sparse population, and severe weather conditions, surface transportation is difficult, and infrastructure is underdeveloped.Mongolia's economic growth has been volatile, with both growth and poverty fluctuating wildly mainly due to Mongolia's dependence on minerals (92.8% of exports). From 2017 to 2019, the country experienced steady gross domestic product growth. However, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) crisis induced an economic contraction of 5.3%, which led to job losses in all major sectors and increased unemployment and underemployment by 1.4 percentage points in 2020._Poverty has most likely increased further from 28.4% of people who lived in poverty as of 2018. The poor condition of roads in Mongolia aggravates persistent poverty conditions, particularly in rural areas as it restricts access to markets, education, and services. Mongolia has a road network of 112,414 kilometers (km), of which 14,918 km are international and state roads and of these only 7,445 km are paved._Improving access to health services and to domestic and external markets will be crucial to assist with recovery from the COVID-19 crisis and to lay the foundations for diversification in the longer term,_particularly in isolated regions such as Western Mongolia. The region suffers from slow development because of its remoteness from the country's political and economic centers, and state roads connecting aimag capitals remain unpaved.Impact, outcome, and outputs.

India,South Asia,Supporting Health Systems Strengthening Projects,"India is one of the fast-growing large economies and its growth averaged over 6.7% between 2015 and 2019. However, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic hit the Indian economy hard. The economy faced its worse ever contraction in fiscal year (FY) 2020 since World War II, contracting at 7.3% in FY2020. Economic activity will continue to remain below the pre-pandemic level despite a strong rebound of 10.0% in FY2021 and 7.5% in FY2022. The government has significantly widened the fiscal deficit to fight the pandemic and support economic and social recovery. Fiscal deficit was revised up to 9.5% (FY2020-2021) amid falling revenue and increased expenditure, from budgeted 4.6% of gross domestic product made last year (FY2019-2020). India has reported over 32.4 million confirmed cases, second largest after the United States as of 22 August 2021. India faced a devastating second wave starting March 2021 and was reporting more the 400,000 COVID-19 positive cases daily for 4 consecutive days and peaked on 7 May 2021 with a record high of 414,188 new COVID-19 cases. Despite the containment measures and increased testing capacity (over 2.2 million samples per day) to detect and isolate cases, COVID-19 threat of impending third wave looms high. Its negative mental and physical health impacts, especially on vulnerable population groups such as urban migrant population and old persons, will require longer-term health system responses.ADB has been a key partner in supporting pandemic response and health system strengthening efforts. ADB's country partnership strategy, 2018-2022 supports expansion of public health service delivery in urban areas with a focus on the poor and vulnerable. In December 2020, the ADB Board approved a $300 million loan to strengthen and improve access to comprehensive primary health care in urban areas in India under PM-ASBY. In addition to the loan, a $2 million technical assistance (TA) grant from ADB's Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction will support for program implementation and coordination, capacity building, and innovation. This support builds on ADB's previous support to urban health system strengthening under NHM amounting to $300 million. ADB was a key partner in supporting COVID-19 response efforts through a COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option with a loan of $1.5 billion. ADB also extended a $3 million grant to support strengthening of points of entry and enhance disease surveillance under the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund. In July 2021, ADB approved a TA to strengthen availability of oxygen supplies and vaccine deployment amount to $7 million, primarily in response to the second wave. ADB is in ongoing discussions with the government to support vaccine procurement efforts under the Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility with a support of $1.5 billion. The government has appreciated the design and implementation of ADB's prior TA, which provided strategic technical inputs through resource persons and expert consultants. Two key lessons emanated from the previous TA implementation. First, it is important to enhance the capacity of executing and implementing agencies in ensuring quality project design, effective project implementation, and overall portfolio performance. ADB support can add value in terms of sharing lessons across projects, introducing innovative approaches, strategic planning, and implementation support in selected states. Second, ADB is in a strategic position to provide integrated and coordinated technical inputs to enhance multisectoral engagement, in line with the vision laid out in ADB strategy 2030 and in complete alignment with government COVID-19 response which adopts the whole of government approach to strengthen response. ADB can promote synergy, effective implementation, expanded private sector participation, and enhanced relevance and quality of health services, all of which will lead to the outcome of a stronger and healthy workforce to support national economic goals.",Active,http://www.adb.org/projects/55262-001/main,29 Dec 2022,2000000.0,1,2022,Health,No

Kazakhstan,Central and West Asia,COVID-19 Solidarity Fund for Kazakhstan,"1.Kazakhstan is facing tremendous challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic and the concurrent plummeting in oil prices started in early 2020, which have jointly contributed to creating an economic and social crisis of unprecedented dimensions. Despite the adoption of government programs aimed at diversifying the economy, Kazakhstan remains heavily dependent on extractive industries as more than 70% of export revenues derived from basic commodities, especially oil and gas. Such production structure, which is typical of countries affected by the so-called ""Dutch disease"", creates pronounced economic vulnerabilities amplifying the impact of the ongoing crisis. 2.At the end of March 2020, the government of the Republic of Kazakhstan requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide support in the establishment of a COVID-19 Solidarity Fund for Kazakhstan to complement the government's efforts made in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, The authorities' request has been motivated by the need to mitigate the impact of the ongoing health and economic crisis on the most vulnerable part of the population and preparing for the post-crisis socio-economic development. In such context, the Ministry of National Economy (MNE) and the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of the Population (MLSPP) requested the ADB to partner with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the World Bank (WB) in the creation and management of the Solidarity Fund (SF). 3.Based on the MNE's proposal, which was further elaborated through a series of informal meetings among prospective partners, and the subsequent support provided to Kazakhstan during March-August 2020 by ADB, UNDP, WB, and other development partners, the SF will focus on delivering training programs to assist workers who lost their jobs due to the pandemic finding new jobs in the post-COVID-19 economy. Initially, the SF was supposed to also assist with the provision of material relief to the population (i.e. food, medicines) and the creation of an online platform for the provision of public services to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). However, these initiatives were covered by Asia Pacific Disaster Response (APDRF) and other government programs which was not anticipated at the time of initial negotiations. The updated request from the government is for the SF to focus on retraining and upgrading of skills for developing capabilities and expertise in industries and sectors expected to provide opportunities for business development in a post-COVID-19 environment. Joint financing and management of TA activities by ADB, UNDP, and the WB in collaboration with the government is expected to produce relevant synergies and complementarities between ADB operations and government development needs.",Active,http://www.adb.org/projects/54265-001/main,11 Dec 2020,1000000.0,1,2020,Education,No

Georgia,Central and West Asia,COVID-19 Emergency Response Project,"Despite significant improvements in recent years, Georgia's public health system remains vulnerable to the health burden posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and crisis. The health sector capacity is limited, physical health infrastructure is inadequate, and there is a lack of trained medical personnel to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Out-of-pocket spending has been declining after the introduction of the Universal Healthcare Program in 2013, but still accounted for 54.8% of total health spending in 2017. This points to an underlying vulnerability for low income groups, which are particularly at risk as COVID-19 unfolds. About 17.5% of Georgia's population is older than 60 years, while 3.3% of the population is older than 80 years. This poses additional challenges in dealing with the COVID-19 emergency since evidence from other countries suggests that the older populations, especially those with pre-existing health conditions, are at higher risk of contracting the disease and, if infected, often require more intensive care.According to the Global Health Security Index, Georgia's health capacity in clinics, hospitals and community care centers scores low: 18.3 out of 100. This is largely due to the deficit of nursing staff and low hospital bed density. Georgia has only 47.3 nurses per 10,000 population and 26 hospital beds per 10,000 population compared with neighboring countries such as Armenia which has 42 beds per 10,000 population. Critical skills gaps exist in Georgia's healthcare sector and a number of health workers and laboratory staff have to be trained to be able to respond to COVID-19. Some 62% of frontline medical doctors, who are higher risk of infection, are women. With the acceleration of virus transmission rate since September 2020, Georgia's health system is increasingly overwhelmed. According to MoILHSA, as of the second week of November, about 4,500 beds in more than 30 hospitals were already occupied by COVID-19 patients, while only 250 beds were available. The Ministry is working to increase the number of beds available for COVID-19 patients to 8,500 by early December. Health workers are increasingly contracting the disease. The number of infected health workers surpassed 1,700 or 5% of total number of infected as of end October 2020. More resources are needed for management of severe cases, prevention of onward virus transmission and alleviation of strains on health-care services. The government needs support to augment its capacity and constrained financial and human resources to ensure effective and timely lifesaving efforts and respond to the impact of COVID-19.The proposed support from the APDRF will help finance immediate needs and deliver appropriate medical services where required. The government has indicated ADB's support would be used for improvement of laboratory diagnostic and testing capacity, procurement of personal protective equipment and other medical equipment to help the government meet its most urgent needs. Recognizing the unpredictable nature of the situation and the concurrent inflow of support from other sources, flexibility is required, along with close coordination with various sources and partners. Any supplies funded from APDRF grant will be coordinated with other support from development partners to avoid duplication.The APDRF grant will complement ADB's comprehensive package of support to Georgia designed to contain COVID-19 impact. The package includes a $100 million loan approved in May 2020 and a $200 million loan approved in October 2020 to respond to Georgia's immediate health and socioeconomic needs and support a return to inclusive economic growth by addressing the longstanding institutional fragilities in social protection, fiscal and debt management that were exacerbated by the pandemic.

The KSTA is in line with the framework of Strategy 2030 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), wherein both DMCs and the ADB have pledged support to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the related Financing for Development Agenda. The proposed KSTA will capacitate the NSSs of the participating DMCs to produce relevant, accurate and timely economic statistical indicators that are imperative to measure the progress towards the SDGs, particularly Goal 8: Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all; and Goal 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation. The proposed KSTA which is part of the approved workplan of ERCD, supports Strategy 2030's operational plan (OP6) strengthen governance, through enhancing the capacity of the DMCs to produce economic information needed for rigorous evidence-based policy making and program monitoring. Further, the statistics to be produced in the participating DMCs will enable the respective governments and the ADB to track the progress of the country and sector specific gainful participation in global and regional value chains (OP7: Fostering Regional Cooperation and Integration). Currently, due to similar statistical capacity building initiatives undertaken so far by EROD-SDI, ERCD produces global and regional value chain participation indices and analyses, including regional spillover analysis, for more than 20 regional member countries. As a result of this proposed KSTA the number of DMCs for which comprehensive value chain participation information and advanced measures of regional cooperation and integration (RCI) are available is expected to increase by at least 10, including many in the Pacific.The proposed KSTA will also enable the ADB to expand its economic databases by the inclusion of critical statistics relevant to the poorest and most vulnerable countries in the region, including fragile and conflict-affected situations and small island developing states. These databases are currently being employed by ERCD to provide economic impact analysis for the purposes of COVID-19 Active Response Expenditure Support (CARES) program. Due to ERCD's past and ongoing statistical capacity building work in Thailand and other countries in ASEAN, the department was able to readily compile the necessary data and provide the analysis required for the COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option (CPRO) . ERCD is currently preparing similar analysis for many DMCs.

On 11 March 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. Confirmed COVID-19 cases across South Asia are increasing. The first case in Bhutan was confirmed on 6 March 2020, when a foreign tourist tested positive on 3 March 2020. Until mid-May, positive cases remained below 10. Thereafter, the number of positive cases started increasing rapidly since Bhutanese returning from overseas, reaching 77 on 1 July 2020, of which 50 have recovered with no deaths. Due to stringent measures and lengthier quarantine requirement, i.e., 21 days, Bhutan successfully managed to avoid local transmission so far. In Maldives, the Health Protection Agency (HPA) reported the first case on 7 March 2020. As one of the most densely populated cities in the world, Maldives' capital Mal recorded a significant increase in COVID-19 cases in the first weeks following the first confirmed local transmission on April 15. As of 2 July 2020, the number of confirmed cases had reached 2,382. The country has recorded 1,954 recoveries and 9 deaths. The health systems in both countries are severely strained by increased workload on health workers to carry out surveillance and testing, prioritization of health managers and frontline health workers in preparing for COVID-19 cases at the expense of other health system priorities, stockouts of infection control supplies, and disruptions to routine services including outreach services that are essential for maintaining primary health care.

Kazakhstan,Central and West Asia,COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support Program,"Kazakhstan's economic growth was relatively strong in early 2020above 4%and the macroeconomic outlook for 20202022 of 4% growth on average and continuous fiscal consolidation was in line with the good performance of recent years. But the recessionary effects of the global coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic have now significantly worsened Kazakhstan's macroeconomic outlook. The country's non-oil fiscal deficit as a percentage of its gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020 is now set to widen to 11%, from 8% in 2019 and an originally expected 7% for 2020, which is also a result of the current discretionary countercyclical efforts. This situation will interrupt the downward trajectory from 10% in 2017. Early health and epidemic-control responses. The pre-COVID-19 efforts in early January to build health system response capacity were effective, as were the strict social containment measures implemented since March (i.e., right after the first confirmed cases in the country). But the medical emergency remains a challenge._Economic and social costs of COVID-19 response. The non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to slow down the spread of the virus imposed significant restrictions on Kazakhstan's non-oil economy and seriously hurt the country's macroeconomic outlook. Several enterprise surveys undertaken in early April indicate that (i) by the end of March, 48% of employees had been put on leave without pay and 13% had been terminated; and (ii) for the second quarter of 2020, an estimated 40% of employees could be put on leave without pay and 12% could be terminated. Tourism, hospitality, education, food services, retail trade, and manufacturing were among the areas hit hardest. Also, women tend to be particularly affected by restrictions on economic activitythey account for more than 65% of the labor force in areas such as hospitality, education, and wholesale and retail trade; own or manage most of the microenterprises; and also represent a significant share of the informal labor market. Various estimates point to a loss of 1% of GDP per week of social lockdown._ Pandemic-caused global recession reaching Kazakhstan. The economic difficulties that Kazakhstan began experiencing in March are now being compounded by (i) a new oil price shock (and the collapse in the prices of other commodities), and (ii) the sudden stop of global capital flows into emerging markets. These direct consequences of the global pandemic halved the prices of 85% of Kazakhstan's export goods . Exchange rate pressures were eased by allowing a 20% depreciation of the tenge and by raising the policy rate, which increased the debt-servicing costs across the economy. Pressures on the asset quality of banks are already constraining the provision of new liquidity to microenterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This added to the ongoing disruptions outlined in para 4. Without a fiscal response, the economy will contract by 5% or more. The poor and vulnerable, including women, can be disproportionately affected. Poverty rates may reach 11%13% (from 6.6% now).Robust and comprehensive government response. To counter this sequence of shocks, the government decided on a comprehensive package of medical, public health, and countercyclical fiscal measures totaling T5.9 trillion (8%9% of GDP, or about $13 billion). The government will self-fund more than 81% of this, including with additional transfers of $4.7 billion$5 billion from the National Fund of the Republic of Kazakhstan (NFRK). The remaining $2 billion of net new financing needs require foreign and domestic debt issuance. The sound pre-shock macroeconomic management record of the government is instrumental in giving credibility to its recent monetary and macroprudential policy decisions in banking and exchange-rate markets. The proposed assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will help the government mitigate the medical and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on Kazakhstan, and support its (i) immediate COVID-19 health policy response, (ii) social protection and employment recovery measures, and (iii) overall stimulus measures._Kazakhstan's CPRO eligibility is summarized in Table 1 and detailed in Appendix 4.

The program is based on extensive policy dialogue with the government and development partner coordination. It draws on lessons from ADB's experience with Countercyclical Support Facility loans during different emergency and crisis situations. These lessons are even more pertinent for the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, which requires parallel interventions on several fronts. The lessons include (i) the timeliness of the countercyclical response to stabilize the economy and protect livelihoods; (ii) targeting of social assistance to prevent large-scale unemployment and poverty; (iii) channeling support through the government budget to ensure coordination, and efficient execution and monitoring, of expenditures; (iv) ensuring adequate support for the government's rapidly evolving financing needs without jeopardizing fiscal sustainability; and (v) placing the emergency support within a medium- to long-term development context with flexibility to make changes.

It complements the ongoing and proposed policy dialogue and program, project, and technical assistance (TA) pipeline, aimed at improving (i) health systems; (ii) technical and vocational skills; (iii) the enabling environment for private sector development, including SMEs and publicprivate partnerships; (iv) public resource management and SOE reforms; and (v) regional cooperation and integration. ADB's support for strengthening the health sector capacity under the Primary Health Care Improvement Project,_a grant of $1.56 million allocated for Uzbekistan to procure medical supplies and equipment under its regional TA for COVID-19,_and the proposed emergency assistance loan of $100 million under the COVID-19 Emergency Response Project_will complement the program. ADB's overall health sector support is a unique value addition, as it not only helps enhance the testing, diagnosis, and clinical treatment capacity of COVID-19 patients but also strengthens the preventive health system to improve the country's resilience to future public health disasters. Together with ongoing and planned health-related projects, the program will generate a substantial regional public good by strengthening regional cooperation among CAREC countries to control the spread of COVID-19 through sharing of information, medical supplies, and staff for pandemic management and the adoption of WHO-recommended standards and best practices._The program also facilitates regional integration through its support for export-oriented SMEs and cross-border trade in goods and services. ADB's proposed policy-based loans for 2020 will complement the support for SMEs and financial inclusion, financial market development, and SOE reforms in the energy sector.The program implementation will be monitored by an ongoing TA through allocating additional resources. This TA will also support the medium-term public sector reforms including (i) the policy formulation for emergency expenditures and social transfers under the medium-term budget framework; (ii) strengthening investment planning and outcome-based budgeting for health and social expenditures; (iii) developing a formula-based intergovernmental fiscal transfer system in line with local governments' enhanced role in service delivery during disasters; (iv) debt and fiscal risk management; (v) risk-based banking supervision; and (vi) developing suitable financial services in state-owned banks for businesses affected by the pandemic.

New support has been proposed to ADB, namely the (i) Secondary Education Sector Improvement Program to enhance the quality and relevance and learning outcomes of STEM subjects along with 21st century skills at the senior secondary level, essential for preparing Sri Lankan graduates for a knowledge-centered economy; and (ii) proposed Innovation Capacity Development in Higher Education Project.The government appreciated the design and implementation of ADB's prior technical assistance (TA), which provided strategic technical inputs through resource persons and expert consultants to project preparation and implementation and is nearly completed. The government has requested similar support for project implementation and future project processing. Two key lessons emanated from the previous TA implementation. First, it is important to enhance the capacity and competencies of executing and implementing agencies in ensuring quality project design, effective project implementation, and overall portfolio performance. Successful outcomes of ADB support in the health and education sectors require consolidating and sharing lessons and good practices, combined with dedicated capacity building for project design and implementation. ADB support in strengthening government capacity can add value in terms of sharing lessons across projects, introducing innovative approaches, strategic planning, and implementation support in selected areas. Second, ADB is in a strategic position to provide integrated and coordinated technical inputs across the three subsectors in education (secondary, TVET, and higher education) and health. Working across these three subsectors and with the health system, ADB can promote synergy, effective implementation, expanded private sector participation, and enhanced relevance and quality of education and health services, all of which will lead to the outcome of a stronger and healthy workforce to support national economic goals.",Active,http://www.adb.org/projects/54061-001/main,25 Aug 2020,2700000.0,1,2020,Education,No

Mongolia,East Asia,Supporting Renewable Energy Development,"The ensuing project is to support the government of Mongolia in expanding renewable energy. In spite of vast renewable energy potential, Mongolia depends on 93% of total electricity production from coal fired thermal power plants. Coal has also been used as the primary source for heating. As a result, the energy sector becomes the major contributor to large greenhouse gas emissions and serious air pollution in the country. The air pollution level in Ulaanbaatar and other towns have become worse than that in cities such as Beijing and New Delhi. UNICEF warned that this has become the public health crisis, especially among children. Nevertheless, the use of coal cannot be reduced to meet growing domestic demand for electricity and heating. To be worse, the peak demand for electricity has almost been reaching to the present generation capacity limit. Under the situation, the country has overcome any power shortfall through more expensive power import from Russia. Thus, the energy security and social and economic impacts have been toward conflicting and complicating situation. To tackle the dilemma, the government issued the State Policy on Energy, 20152030 to increase the share of renewable energy to 20% by 2023 and 30% by 2030. ADB's country partnership strategy and country operations business plan (COBP) for Mongolia responded to this priority to expand renewable energy even in remote and less developed regions, and to enable air quality and carbon footprint improvements. Subsequently, the government's mid-term plan for 20192023 includes concrete activities for renewable energy development. For this purpose, this transaction technical assistance (TA) was programmed for 2019 and the ensuing loan project for 2021 in the COBP, 20202021. Given the strategy and rationale, the following were the intended outputs of the ensuing project:(i)Output 1: Transmission strengthened to help evacuate more renewable energy to grid. (ii)Output 2: Pilot pumped storage hydropower generation assessed for detailed engineering studies. (iii)Output 3: Pilot geothermal heat and power generation assessed for detailed engineering studies. (iv)Output 4: Advance heating technologies deployed. However, given project readiness, the project scope has been revised to focus on the transmission expansion and a cleaner heating pilot. The project impact will be increased renewable energy capacity, and the outcome will be increased and diversified clean energy supply schemes.The ensuing project is estimated to cost $150 million. ADB will consider a project loan of $140.0 million from ADB's ordinary capital resources, and the balance is expected to be supported by cofinanciers and/or the government.",Active,http://www.adb.org/projects/52240-002/main,11 Feb 2020,50000.0,1,2020,Energy,Yes

The PBL comprises 13 policy actions under tranche 1 and 14 policy actions under tranche 2. The FIL will focus on delivering output 3 of the program.3. Output 1: Policy, regulatory, and legal framework for the mortgage finance industry strengthened. The government will revise and strengthen the existing housing policy and subsidy framework, which is presently distorting the financial system (i.e., government housing programs are provided at below-market rates, crowding out market funding and pricing). Activities include review of the existing, and establishment of better targeted, subsidy programs that reach lower-income households. Some of the changes under tranche 1 of the PBL are aimed at reducing excessive subsidies and their regressive nature. Policy actions under tranche 2 of the PBL will further deepen these reforms to enhance the fiscal sustainability and effectiveness of pro-poor targeting. The transition, which the UMRC will facilitate, toward stronger private sector participation in the development of the housing sector will be supported by (i) introducing a new category of financial institutions specializing in mortgage refinancing activities, (ii) mandating the Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU) to supervise and regulate this new category of financial institutions, and (iii) developing new regulations on mortgage lending to induce sound lending practices by banks.4. Output 2: Housing finance strategy and subsidy framework strengthened. Tranche 1 of the PBL will establish the institutional mechanisms required to effectively implement and rationalize the government's housing subsidy framework. The government will establish the HAU to coordinate all existing housing policies and subsidy programs. In the initial phase, the HAU will take stock of the existing government housing programs and redefine the eligibility criteria for beneficiaries, review the housing policy framework, and agree on a road map that sets out priorities for the required legal and policy reforms. Ultimately, the HAU will become a single point of contact for all housing programs and subsidy schemes, with the objectives of reducing the excessive burden on the public budget and improving efficiency and sustainability. The HAU will also increase coverage by developing innovative and new housing finance solutions and instruments (such as the up-front and one-time subsidy schemes for low-income beneficiaries, and rental programs in the housing sector).5. The following actions will be carried out by the government under tranche 2 of the PBL to facilitate implementation of outputs 1 and 2: (i) introduction of a pilot program of income-based up-front housing subsidies for low-income families and preparation of a feasibility study for a new government-sponsored housing assistance scheme; (ii) development of a comprehensive housing and mortgage market database; (iii) eventual transformation of the HAU into an independent housing agency; (iv) preparation and approval of a new system for the collection and timely dissemination of statistical data and information on the housing sector, which will ultimately lead to the establishment of a house price index; (v) review and amendment of the current prudential and regulatory framework governing housing finance and mortgage lending in line with international norms; and (vi) comprehensive review of the housing sector (demand and supply sides) to identify areas and initiatives to promote greater competition by introducing international best practices. A feasibility study will also look into the future roles and relevance of the two dominant state-owned real estate developers.6. Output 3: The establishment and operationalization of the mortgage refinancing company supported with long-term funding. Under this output (solely addressed by the FIL), ADB will provide long-term funding to the proposed UMRC to make long-term local currency resources available to banks to fund residential mortgage and housing improvement loans. The UMRC will facilitate the provision of mortgage loans at an interest rate close to market rates (with an average loan maturity of 10 years), and address the demand for housing improvement loans, which are currently unavailable in the market. The UMRC will address a fundamental market constraint that is preventing banks from expanding their housing finance portfolios, by better matching their assets and liabilities. The UMRC will provide loans to participating financial institutions (PFIs) that are secured by eligible mortgage loans, based on criteria that will assess product design, market-based pricing, underwriting practices, loan documentation, and performance. This will help to professionalize the overall housing finance industry and address the risks associated with broadening access to housing finance across new borrower segments. Eligibility criteria will also target end-beneficiaries that are currently underserved by the banking sector. In the medium to long term, the UMRC will support more exponential sector growth by using new debt instruments such as corporate bonds, covered bonds, and/or mortgage-backed securities to mobilize long-term funds from institutional investors.",Active,http://www.adb.org/projects/51348-001/main,10 Feb 2020,50000000.0,1,2020,Finance,No

Tajikistan,Central and West Asia,Tourism Development Project,"Tajikistan is recognized as a potential tourism hotspot because of its mountainous topography, natural assets, culture, and history as an important link along the old Silk Road. However, this potential remains largely untapped for various reasons, including poor connectivity, inadequate infrastructure, the absence of a comprehensive tourism ecosystem to ensure quality service delivery, weak institutional and regulatory capacity, and a poor business environment. The government has adopted modest measures to promote tourism, including the introduction of an e-visa system and the provision of tax exemptions for investments in tourism-related facilities such as small hotels and motels, hunting and fishing facilities, and mountaineering infrastructure. However, it has yet to formulate a tourism satellite account (TSA), which is a strategic prerequisite for developing and monitoring the tourism industry in the country and Asian Development Bank (ADB) support is needed to move the government's development efforts to the next level. Project Outputs and activitiesOutput 1: This output will prepare a tourism development plan based on the following three subcomponents.(i)Develop a tourism satellite account. The PRF will help Tajikistan develop its first TSA as well as build capacity for the government to periodically develop future TSAs. The Committee of Tourism Development (CTD) under the Government of Tajikistan, the executing agency, will undertake this subcomponent in coordination with the Economic Research and Regional Cooperation Department, ADB and UNWTO, which has helped countries around the world adopt TSAs. CTD will establish a destination management organization and will also draft tourism plans for heritage sites with the support of UNWTO.(ii)Characterize market demand and undertake skills mapping for the tourism ecosystem. This subcomponent will address data deficiencies related to strategic prioritization, namely, analysis of demand for Tajikistan's tourism attractions. It shall support assess needed skills versus available skills for the tourism ecosystem, assess training needs (in particular for women), and explore the potential for women to enter into tourism jobs that are not traditionally female-oriented.(iii)Institutional strengthening and creating an enabling environment. This subcomponent will strengthen the structure, staff capacity, and business processes of the executing agency, the CTD; streamline interministerial and interagency coordination; improve interaction between public and private sector organizations; enhance capacity of the agencies directly linked to tourism (such as the Agency of Statistics under the President of the Republic of Tajikistan, and the ministries of transport, finance, and internal affairs) to collect and assess tourism-related information; and identify priority policy actions related to improving connectivity (air and land), airport and border procedures, and ease of doing tourism-related businesses. The PRF will facilitate increased coordination with Uzbekistan, which is the largest potential tourism market in the region and can provide a valuable boost to Tajikistan tourism through joint product development.Output 2: The PRF will identify priority investments and policy actions to promote the targeted tourism categories and regions. An investment pipeline comprising at least two stand-alone and two multisector projects will be developed. The projects may comprise public sector, private sector and public-private partnership. Output 3: The CTD will firm up the investment pipeline by carrying out feasibility studies of the projects in the pipeline. These will comprise technical, economic, financial, social, and environmental due diligence; gender and safeguards assessment; categorization of subprojects in accordance with ADB's Safeguards Policy Statement (2009); and financial management and procurement capacity assessment of the executing and implementing agencies of ensuing projects. The CTD will coordinate completion of the detailed engineering design and procurement documents of all subprojects, and link and supplementary documents for report and recommendation of the president for ensuing projects, with the respective sector agencies.

This included grant cofinancing of $54.73 million from Australia and New Zealand which reflects the importance and value their governments place on introducing reforms and building capacity for private sector development in the Pacific. The technical assistance (TA) for Phase IV (PSDI IV) will build on Phase III achievements across six core areas of focus: access to finance, business law reform, state-owned enterprise reform, public-private partnerships, competition and consumer protection, and the economic empowerment of women. PSDI IV will retain these areas of focus and also respond to climate change and labor mobility by incorporating these issues into relevant subprojects. A 2018 review of PSDI by ADB's Independent Evaluation Department (IED) found that the first three phases helped provide several important inputs necessary for establishing modern, functioning private sectors in Pacific DMCs. While concluding that PSDI remained relevant and well-aligned with these DMCs' needs, IED made recommendations aimed at improving outcomes. These recommendations have been incorporated into PSDI IV. PSDI IV is consistent with ADB's Strategy 2030 and aligned with the strategic priorities of ADB's Pacific Approach, 2016-2020.

All ensuing projects are among the Government's priorities for energy sector development under Uzbekistan 2030, and will require similar scope of safeguard, financial management and economic assessments. Social (labor), human resources, and training needs assessments will also be undertaken for the policy component of the proposed Gas Sector Development Program.Natural gas is the most important indigenous source of energy in Uzbekistan and is regarded as one of the driving forces of the country's economy. At present, the energy sector contributes to over 20% of national tax revenues and 18% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP). Natural gas is over 80% of the country's energy mix and 85% of electricity generated. Uzbekistan's aging and dilapidated infrastructure in the whole energy chain increasingly results in system inefficiencies, unreliable gas and electricity supply that dampens the economic development and business confidence, and uneven access to electricity across provinces contributing towards widening regional income disparities. The obsolete energy transmission and distribution systems have developed serious problems overtime, such as increasingly frequent electricity blackouts and insufficient gas available especially during peak demand times in the winter, putting social service systems such as education and health care at risk.In 2017, Uzbekistan initiated comprehensive economic reforms liberalizing its exchange rate to solve long-standing difficulties associated with limited access to foreign exchange and requirements to surrender foreign exchange resulted in structural and economic distortions. The liberalization of the foreign exchange regime and local currency devaluation created additional challenges to energy utilities massively distorting their value of assets, capital structures and revenue generation under existing governance and financial management frameworks. To recover the sustainability of energy utilities, the government launched several initiatives and legislative acts for sector reforms that includes: (i) development of cost reflective energy tariffs (ii) adoption of international financial reporting standards (IFRS) and disclosures and (iii) strengthening financial management and corporate governance frameworks",Active,http://www.adb.org/projects/52322-002/main,22 Feb 2019,3375000.0,1,2019,Energy,Yes

People's Republic of China,East Asia,Air Quality Improvement in the Greater Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei Region—Shandong Clean Heating and Cooling Project,"The proposed project will implement three clean heating and cooling subprojects to accelerate air pollution abatement in Shandong Province. The heating and cooling projects proposed are innovative, as they will combine renewable energy technologies and waste heat recovered from industry and power plants to reduce the energy and carbon intensity of heat production and refrigeration, and thereby reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, as well as the heat island effect in urban areas. An overview of each subproject is provided below.Subproject 1: West Jinan Waste Heat Utilization and Clean Energy Subproject.This subproject will provide heat to urban residents, industrial, and business customers. The technologies to be used on the project include: (i) Large temperature difference waste heat exchange technology is adopted for transporting waste heat from the nearby power plants to the city, which will increase the heat transport capacity by more than 50% than using the standard technology, and same time reduce electricity consumption for cycling pumps. The large temperature difference is achieved by lowering the temperature of return water to the primary pipeline. The waste heat will be used to supply heating to about 80 million m2 of buildings; (ii) Year-round heat supply needs to be provided to an industrial park with industrial and business customers located in west Jinan. A biomass-based combined heating and power plant using biomass briquette made of agriculture waste will supply heating to 1.54 million m2 buildings and will generate electricity of 133 GWh per year. A feedstock assessment showed that only 12% of the available agriculture waste will be consumed by the biomass plant; (iii) Jinan is endowed with geothermal resources. Deep-well geothermal offers an environmentally friendly alternative to the current practice of using coal-based space heating. Deep-well reinjection technology will be used to extract and exchange heat from the underground water, which will then be filtered and recharged back to the same aquifer; and (iv) For a few newly built resident communities not covered by the heating network and where geothermal resource is not available, distributed gas-fired boilers will be used. This subproject enables Jinan to fully utilize waste heat in the neighboring regions, to form a waste heat-dominated heating system, with distributed energy supply from biomass, geothermal and natural gas as supplementary.Subproject 2: Shanghe Coal-Free Clean Heating Demonstration Subproject. This subproject covers the urban area of Shanghe County, the semi-urban area of 11 towns and 80,000 rural households where coal-fired stoves or coal-fired boilers are common for space heating. The subproject will use geothermal energy as the main heat source to replace coal-fired heating. Other clean options, such as air-source heat pump, are selected as distributed heating source where the pipeline network is not available. Gas-fired boilers will be an auxiliary heat source. This subproject also plans to retrofit total 660,400 m2 of urban buildings and 30,000 rural households to improve their energy efficiency. Based on the available resources, heavily polluting coal-fired stoves in 80,000 rural households will be replaced by air-to-air heat pumps, air-to-water heat pumps, heat-storage radiators, carbon crystal plate radiators and small household gas heaters. This subproject will play an important role in, and have demonstration effect to, other counties in the northern PRC who are also facing similar air quality issues caused by the winter heating.Subproject 3: East Jinan Low-Emission Combined District Heating and Cooling Subproject. East Jinan is where the central business district located. The large amount of heating and cooling demands in this area requires a low-emission system supplying both heat and cooling. For heating supply, two options will be used: (i) Industrial waste heat through long-distance pipeline will be used to supply heat to 6.2 million m2 buildings; and (ii) Electrode boilers with heat storage will use off-peak electricity at night, and then deliver hot water to the households in the day time to heat up to 700,000 m2 area. For district cooling, two technologies will be adopted: (i) Ice storage, which uses off-peak electricity during the night and stores the cooling energy in the form of ice. During peak hours in the daytime, ice is melted to provide cooling; and (ii) When the cooling demand is large enough, lithium bromide absorption chiller driven by the waste heat from the power plant will be used to deliver cold water to the consumers through long-distance pipelines. The subproject aims to expand the area of waste heat supply, and at the same time use off-peak electricity to produce and store heating and cooling capacity to improve the waste heat utilization and shift peak load.",Active,http://www.adb.org/projects/51418-001/main,26 Sep 2019,288700000.0,1,2019,Energy,Yes

Viet Nam,South East Asia,Northern Mountain Provinces Transport Connectivity Project,"The project will improve and upgrade two road stretches totaling 198 km that connect several towns and districts in the provinces of Lai Chau, Lao Cai and Yen Bai to the Noi BaiLao Cai Expressway. These road stretches will connect to other main roads under the Lao Cai province transport development master plan to improve network connectivity with the Noi Bai-Lao Cai Expressway. The existing roads pass through very difficult terrain with high mountains or large rivers, so many substandard curves and grades have been adopted. Their conditions are poor; the average travel speed is 25 km per hour and several sections are not passable year round. Therefore, a major rehabilitation or improvement is required to accommodate the expected traffic growth due to the current economic development of the region.The improved connectivity will (i) provide reliable access to basic social services such as education, health care, job training, and emergency disaster relief, and (ii) increase economic and employment opportunities for the people of the northwestern provinces, especially the poor ethnic minorities. The enhanced connectivity to the Noi BaiLao Cai Expressway will provide further opportunities of cross-border trade with the Lao People's Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of China (PRC). The improved roads will help save travel time and costs, hence reducing fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions.

Regional,Regional,The Economic Impacts of the End of Compact Grant Assistance,"The Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), and the Republic of Palau (PAL) face economic and fiscal uncertainties as they approach the end of their respective agreements with the Government of the United States (US) under the Compacts of Free Association (the Compacts)_in fiscal years 2023/2024._One of the key feature of the Compacts is the grant assistance which support a variety of sectors, such as education, health, infrastructure, public sector capacity building, private sector development and environment. FSM, PAL, and RMI will have to fund these sectors when the US grant assistance is discontinued. In addition to grants, another key feature of the Compacts is the establishment of the compact trust funds which are meant to provide the FSM, PAL and RMI governments with a continuing source of income after fiscal years 2023/2024. In May 2018, the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued a report_on the proposed actions required by the governments of FSM and RMI to prepare for the transition to compact trust fund income. The report highlighted that due to the countries' heavy dependence on the US compact grants and programs, accounting for about 33% and 25% of FSM and RMI's respective revenues for fiscal year 2016, the countries will require significant budgetary support to transition to relying on its own trust fund income in the long term. ADB's analysis of the trust fund rules and sustainability in FSM and RMI_showed a decline in the overall trust fund size, indicating insufficient resources to support the countries' expected drawdowns in the long run.ADB's operations in the Pacific are increasing rapidly. Its total portfolio doubled every five years -- from $500 million in 2005, $1 billion in 2010, $2 billion in 2015 -- and is now more than $2.88 billion. For the North Pacific, the portfolio had similarly increased during the same period -- from $50 million in 2005 to $91 million in 2015 -- and is projected to reach more than $200 million in 2019-2021. As ADB's Pacific operations continue to grow, it is important to understand the scale of development assistance required to support the governments of FSM, RMI and PAL after the termination of the compact grant assistance.The proposed small-scale knowledge and support TA will: (i) identify the range of potential reductions in US government assistance to FSM, PAL and RMI, (ii) analyze the potential fiscal and economic shocks for FSM, PAL and RMI, and (iii) identify the range of preparatory and mitigating actions that could be taken by FSM, PAL and RMI, the US government and development partners, including the potential positive effects of a coordinated effort by the parties.",Active,http://www.adb.org/projects/52215-001/main,06 Dec 2018,750000.0,1,2018,Public sector management,No

Uzbekistan,Central and West Asia,Sustainable Energy Access – Distribution Network Modernization Program,"The Uzbekistan economy is at the crossroads. Weakening commodity export prices and a downturn in trading partners import demand is slowing down the economic growth from its average rate of 8% to 5% in 2017. In turn, Uzbekistan embarked on a series of far-reaching reforms to boost its economy including liberalization of foreign exchanges and initiation of structural reforms of state enterprises. The energy sector underpinned Uzbekistan s sustained growth, contributing to 10% of its gross domestic product and a quarter of its exports. The sector is also facing challenges to be more open and market-oriented as the essential first step to lowering the burden on the national budget and to continue urgent investments at scale in critical infrastructure. Uzbekistan s aging and dilapidated infrastructure in the whole power supply chain increasingly results in system inefficiencies, unreliable electricity supply that dampens the economic development and business confidence, and uneven access to electricity across provinces contributing towards widening regional income disparities.Uzbekistan has more than 230,000 km of transmission and distribution lines of which 213,400 km is distribution grid. In the low voltage distribution systems, more than 80% of low voltage cables are under operation over 30 years and 30% of substation transformers require urgent replacement. The obsolete distribution system has developed serious problems overtime, such as overloads, voltage drops related to increased load demand and increasingly frequent blackouts especially during peak demand times in the winter. In urban areas, the backouts still occur for several hours per day due to faults in the distribution system and in some remote villages, disruption of electricity supplies last for days and weeks, putting social service systems such as education and health care at risk.Investment constrains in the transmission and distribution system is largely attributable to high electricity losses, estimated at 20% of net generation. This level is nearly five times the level of losses of high-income countries. Technical losses account for 13.7% of net generation and most of the losses occur on the distribution system at 0.4 to 35kV, which are about three times higher than what could be expected from well performing distribution companies. Investment in distribution networks will help to reduce overloading, improve supply reliability and significantly reduce electricity losses. The additional benefits of distribution network improvements are reduction of carbon emissions through energy efficiency and increased receptivity for greater penetration of renewable resources in the power system, given that 85% of electricity supply in Uzbekistan relies on the combustion of natural gases. The Government has already undertaken steps to improve reliability of its power system through modernization of its power plants, transmission lines and substations between major plants and load centers. The ongoing advanced metering projects will enable reduction of non-technical losses and improvement of financial sustainability of Uzbekenergo, the vertically integrated state-owned power utility. In 2018, the Government launched an integrated economic development initiative that can revitalize the rural economy and help build modern infrastructure in rural and remote areas to ensure that all members of society can participate in and benefit from growth. One of the pillars of this bold program is to improve access to reliable electricity services by modernizing the distribution network. The Government requested ADB s assistance to apply innovative and country-based system to improve the results of this initiative. The overall investment needs for generation, transmission and distribution under Uzbekenergo's Electric Power Industry Development Strategy 2030 is more than $20 billion and the distribution network modernization only accounts for $2 billion.

Road construction is ongoing and the Ministry of Transport and Roads (MOTR) of the Kyrgyz Republic is the executing agency for the project. The project has been characterized by some construction-induced damage to residential and other structures that are adjacent to the road's right of way. This damage observed to date has resulted in complaints from people residing in these structures, and a consequent impact on construction progress due to the adoption of less damaging construction methods, primarily the prohibition of the use by the contractor of vibrating roller equipment. Due to concern over the additional time required to complete the project without this equipment, and the related additional costs that will be incurred, ADB will assist with (i) undertaking a study to quantify to the extent possible the potential impacts and costs that might arise from reverting to the original construction approach, specifically the use of vibrating compaction equipment; and (ii) financing such study as the available funds under the ongoing project are insufficient. These impacts could be both physical, such as damage to structures, and social safeguards related, including the temporary relocation of households occupying structures that could be damaged.

Overall, the electricity demand has far outgrown the supply, leading to load curtailment and increased dependence on imports from India in recent times. The peak suppressed demand in Nepal in FY2013 2014 has been around 1,200 megawatt (MW) as against installed capacity of 787 MW, hence resulting in a deficit of about 440 MW due to non-availability of generation. Government has plans to generate additional 10,000 MW in the next 10 years. About 63% of the population in Nepal has access to electricity but the supply quality is unreliable and inadequate. The government has recognized the immediate need for reinforcement and upgrade of outdated distribution systems crucial to deliver the required energy to the customers even if the generation and transmission lines are in place. In this regard, the need for immediate distribution network enhancement is included in the government's action plan to address energy crisis and provide universal access to reliable and efficient electricity for all by 2030.

Uzbekistan,Central and West Asia,Western Uzbekistan Water Supply System Development Project,"Spanning more than 165,000 square kilometers, the RK covers the entire northwestern extremity of Uzbekistan. It has a dispersed population of about 1.8 million, and its primary economic drivers are agriculture, natural gas, and minerals. The RK's natural environment is primarily arid desert comprising sparse, barren lands that are subject to severe drought. As such, the RK suffers from acute surface water shortage. Although aquifers exist, the groundwater is mostly saline and of limited value, as it is prohibitively expensive to treat for human consumption. Water supply conditions are therefore critical.Municipal water supply services in the RK are provided by a regional WSS utility, the State Unitary Enterprise Department for Operation of Interregional Water Supply Tuyamuyun-Nukus (TN). Although operational, TN faces considerable challenges as most of its Soviet-era infrastructure has depreciated to the point of dilapidation. Its services are unreliable, leakage losses are high, and water quality is a growing concern. These deficiencies prevent TN from delivering services that meet regulator and public expectations, which in turn undermines consumer confidence and willingness to pay, increases regulator reluctance to raise tariffs, and reduces financial and institutional performance. As with similar utilities in Uzbekistan, has become locked in a vicious cycle that requires external intervention to modernize and expand its asset base while overhauling its institutional capacity.TN's service deficiencies relate directly to poor WSS sector performance. In the RK, only 36.6% of the population in Karakalpakstan12.9% in rural areasis connected to the centralized water supply system. Recent surveys indicate that 40% of households receive water for less than 6 hours per week and that water pressures are often low. About 75% of households reportedly experience excessive water salinity and hardness issues. Correlations are also frequently drawn between poor water quality and waterborne disease incidence. The substantial consumer base that is yet to be connected to a centralized water supply is forced to purchase water from trucked supplies at exorbitant prices or consume water that is increasingly polluted. The government fully recognized the sector constraints and, with support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other development partners, has responded by implementing a phased, nationwide institutional consolidation and sector-wide management, financial, and cost recovery reform program. The initial phase, driven largely by the Decree of the Cabinet of Ministers No. 306, has led to the consolidation of Karakalpakstan's WSS services into TN and the implementation of more than 40 time-bound corporate governance improvements to strengthen utility capacity. The second phase is overhauling the wider institutional framework by creating the Ministry of Housing and Communal Services (MHCS). The Agency Kommunhizmat (CSA), reporting to the MHCS, is responsible for implementing externally funded projects including those funded by ADB. The project supports the government's WSS reform program by helping improve TN's institutional capacity while revitalizing its regional water supply system. It will benefit 388,000 inhabitants in six districts and 116 rural settlements by providing reliable and safe water supply through universal metered household connections. It is consistent with ADB's Water Operational Plan, 20112020 and country operations business plan, 20182020 for Uzbekistan. Lessons to be incorporated in the project design include (i) securing timely counterpart support by engaging government agencies at the early stage of project preparation, (ii) improving project quality and efficiency by adopting least-cost solutions in project design, (iii) providing training and capacity building of project implementation personnel to reduce procurement and construction delay, and (iv) accelerating domestic approval procedures by engaging design institutes during project preparation.",Active,http://www.adb.org/projects/50259-002/main,15 May 2019,8740000.0,1,2019,Water and other urban infrastructure and services,Yes

Samoa,The Pacific,Preparing the Central Cross Island Road Upgrading Project,"The Government of Samoa requested the Asian Development Bank's (ADB) assistance for Central Cross Island Road Upgrading (the ensuing Project) a priority investment in transport sector. Samoa's land transport depends on key arterial roads that serve the two main islands, Upolu where capital Apia is located, and Savai'i. Upolu is served by three cross-island roads strategically located at the eastern, western, and central sections. The Central Cross Island Road is the key arterial road connecting West Coast Road in Apia with the South Coast Road in Siumu. The project road is 19.70 kilometers (km) that provides access to 8 villages to the capital, Apia. The existing two-lane narrow carriageway (4 meters 5 meters) road with surface seal carrying up to 6,000 average daily traffic (ADT) along first 5 km, and up to 1,500 ADT thereafter, is unsafe for road users and in need of upgrading. The project will also improve institutional capacity of executing and implementing agencies to plan, execute and maintain investment projects and will provide support to the Ministry of Natural Resource and Environment (MNRE) to improve their capacity in updating the current cadastral system.The socioeconomic impacts from upgrading are expected to improve access to public services, particularly increase in rate of tertiary education, faster, and safer access to medical services, and spur economic activity in medium- to long-term through increase in tourism activities. Samoa's economy is based on subsistence level primary production. Crops, livestock, fisheries, and forestry account for 42% of gross domestic product (GDP) and provides 75% of the employment in the country. Tourism is growing and now represents 25% of the GDP. According to the Samoan Central Bank, the tourism sector is a key driver of country's economic development as it provides considerable employment and generates foreign exchange. The upgraded and climate change-proofed cross island road is also a major contribution to the island's disaster preparedness as it provides an alternate route for evacuation and post disaster relief and rehabilitation work between the northern and southern coasts.The upgrading of the project road will result in a more reliable and safer road network. The project will be aligned with the following impacts as envisioned in the government's Transport Sector Plan 2014 2019: (i) Goal 1 strengthen transport sector governance framework; and (ii) Goal 2 improve, sustain, and climate-proof road transport network.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/51268-002/main,16 May 2018,800000.0,1,2018,Transport,No
Regional,Regional,Sustainable Infrastructure for Asia and the Pacific,"The proposed knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will address key sustainable infrastructure development issues and expand potential investment opportunities on sustainable infrastructure for ADB developing member countries (DMCs). The proposed TA is aligned with the midterm review of ADB's Finance Sector Operational Plan (FSOP) which affirms ADB's critical role in infrastructure finance and with ADB's commitment to host the 2018 Global Infrastructure Forum. Furthermore, the Sustainable Development Goals and COP21 agreement underline the importance of infrastructure finance, particularly the respective roles of the public and private sectors, as well as multilateral development banks (MDBs) in the development agenda. MDBs are increasingly being called upon to play a greater role in this agenda and there are numerous initiatives being advanced by the MDBs, as well as other institutions, governments, and entities. ADB must respond to these expectations and ensure that the institution continues to remain relevant and engaged in these infrastructure finance initiatives. ADB's role can be multifaceted and include providing direct funding, supporting capital market issues and providing structural and transaction advisory services to both the public and private sectors. The proposed TA is an endorsed corporate priority TA.Strategy 2020, a long-term strategic framework of ADB, addresses the importance of infrastructure finance as a core specialization.

Although the port requires about 1.9 hectares of gross container terminal area to meet projected demand by 2035, the current area is only 1.4 hectares due to inefficient flow of container handling due to damaged areas within the terminal area, and sub-optimal location of utilities. The project will repair damaged areas on wharf deck, upgrade lighting, provide appropriate pavement, provide additional reefer capacity, and reconfigure container terminal layout for efficiency. The government has also requested ADB''s support to urgently replace one tugboats, which has expired its operational life. 3.Border Security and Trade Facilitation. To enhance border security and facilitate trade, the government intends to upgrade and implement a modern risk-based intelligent customs management system. The project will provide a new container x-ray scanner and new customs examination facility. 4.Gender sensitive green port initiatives. To address the lack of coordinated effort to tackle environmental issues, the proposed pilot of green port initiatives would develop procedures for monitoring compliance and environmental performance.

Lao People's Democratic Republic,South East Asia,Health Sector Governance Program (Subprogram 2),"Equitable and inclusive growth. The 8th Five-Year National Socio-Economic Development Plan (NSEDP) (2016 2020) aims for the Lao PDR to graduate from least-developed country status by 2020, and become an upper middle-income country by 2030. Forecasts for 2017 indicate that the country's gross domestic product (GDP) grew 6.8%, resulting in GDP per capita of $2,579, and its poverty rate fell to 20.0%. Significant development challenges remain, however, including (i) a high fiscal deficit, (ii) accumulated public and publicly guaranteed debt, and (iii) an undiversified resource-based economy. The government recognizes that equitable and inclusive growth requires targeted policy interventions for vulnerable groups, and the NSEDP commits sustained investment to improve access to and the quality of basic social services such as health care, with a view to improving health outcomes, especially for the poor, women, and children. Better health of the workforce results in lower absenteeism, higher labor productivity, and increased wages, all of which contribute to economic growth. Such effects are particularly important in countries where many are engaged in unskilled labor. Unfulfilled health targets. The Lao PDR has made good progress in achieving many health targets: (i) life expectancy in 2015 was 68 years, and (ii) the maternal mortality ratio decreased from 905 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1995 to 206 deaths in 2015 (the MDG target is 260). Compared with other Asian countries, however, the Lao PDR fares poorly on key health indicators, including those for maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH), which impedes full achievement of the health-related SDGs. The country's under-5 mortality rate remains the highest in Southeast Asia at 86 deaths per 1,000 live births 2015 (the MDG target is 70), and infant mortality rate in 2016 was 48.9 deaths per 1,000 infants, above the MDG target of 45. Child malnutrition, or underweight children under 5 years of age, dropped to 26.5% in 2011 (more recent data are not available), above the target of 20% (footnote 12). Communicable diseases such as HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis are prevalent. The incidence of non communicable diseases, accidents, and injuries remains significant as well; the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that non communicable diseases constituted 60% of the burden of disease in 2008, while accidents and injuries accounted for 10%. Limited utilization of health care services. Poor health outcomes are closely linked to the limited use of health services. The overall use of public health services is reported to have increased fivefold during 2000 2013 to about 0.6 visits per person per year (footnote 12), but this is still low and gaps in coverage remain between the poor and rich, and rural and non-rural populations, especially for MNCH services, including immunization, antenatal care, skilled birth attendance, and surgery.

Tonga,The Pacific,Tropical Cyclone Gita Emergency Response Project,"Tropical Cyclone (TC) Gita, a category 4 cyclone, struck Tonga on 12 and 13 February 2018, causing widespread destruction on the main island of Tongatapu, including the capital of Nuku'alofa, and the neighboring island of Eua. With sustained winds of 230 kmh and gusts to 278 kmh, it was one of the most powerful cyclones recorded in Tonga's history. It is estimated that more than 79,500 people (or around 79% of the population) were directly affected. Destructive winds, storm surges and flooding from TC Gita caused severe damage to government buildings, homes, and infrastructure for basic services, including water supply, waste and sanitation, electricity, and communications. The situation report number 4 issued by Tonga's National Emergency Management Office (NEMO) on 15 February 2018 states that more than 4,500 people sought shelter on Tongatapu. Preliminary estimates show that about 50% of homes in on Tongatapu are damaged or destroyed (1,131 homes damaged, and 119 destroyed). Tonga's historic Parliament House and other public buildings such as the Office of the Prime Minister, were destroyed. It is estimated that 80% of the electricity network in the greater Nuku'alofa area is damaged, affecting not only power supply but water pumps and thus water supply as well.

Kazakhstan,Central and West Asia,Support to Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurship Development,"Strategic context. Limited access to finance is one of the major challenges facing companies in Kazakhstan. Intrinsic difficulty in obtaining credit constrains firm development, undermines competitiveness, and lessens investment attractiveness for potential investors, limiting growth opportunities. A recent World Bank survey suggests that more than half of firms in Kazakhstan consider access to finance as a _moderate to severe_ obstacle to their growth. A key factor hampering credit access is an underperforming financial sector that insufficiently responds to the needs of the private sector, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) outside the cities of Almaty and Astana.Difficulty in access to finance, especially for SMEs is increasing the vulnerability of the financial sector. Major issues in this regard include: (a) weak lending activity by commercial banks mainly caused by a large stock of non-performing loans, (ii) overreliance on the banking sector due to poor development of the country's capital market, (iii) poor financial literacy of the general population, and (iv) outdated information and communication technology and digitalization of the banking sector. In early 2017, the Kazakhstan Resident Mission (KARM) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) together with the government of the Kostanay region of Kazakhstan held extensive discussions with local entrepreneurs to identify demand-side constraints to business development and financial intermediation. In September 2017, an ADB reconnaissance mission met with major commercial banks operating in the Kostanay region to analyze supply-side constraints for SME finance. The demand- and supply-side analyses revealed a substantial asymmetry of information between potential SME borrowers and local financial institutions (LFIs). The information available to LFIs on business creditworthiness of SMEs seemed to be fairly limited. While such deficiency constrains the LFIs' capacity to assess the risk of new loans to SMEs, LFIs often do not provide sufficient and timely information to local entrepreneurs on loan requirements and transaction costs. Local entrepreneurs lack knowledge and understanding of available financial products and services to make informed decisions on sources and structure of financing for investment projects. The existing asymmetry of information is a major factor behind the relatively high rejection rate on loan applications (particularly for women entrepreneurs), undermining long-term trust of the local businesses in the financial sector. More than 30% of surveyed firms in a recent World Bank country enterprise survey for Kazakhstan had loan applications rejected as opposed to 9% on average for the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region. Only 19% of Kazakhstan's firms received a bank loan or a credit line, compared to an average of 36% for the entire ECA region. Discussions with the LFIs operating in the Kostanay region revealed that the resource and investment mobilization required to address credit needs of SMEs continue to be held up by the unattractive economics of financing SMEs. Given the Kostanay region's relatively large size and low population, LFIs don't see immediate benefits of scaling up formal banking infrastructure. In this regard, the ADB missions to Kostanay suggest that digital financial solutions (DFS) are needed to close gaps in financial inclusion and promote SME development. Such DFS enhance access to credit by allowing access to alternative data sources, such as payment transactions and telecommunications data, improving, in turn, customer profiling, credit risk assessment and fraud detection.The extensive dialogue conducted by KARM with the regional administration served to articulate a program for sustained assistance to: (i) better understand presence of SMEs in the region; (ii) develop a system to appreciate LFIs' creditworthiness; (iii) introduce DFS as needed; (iv) improve SMEs business functions (especially financial management); and (v) enhance the level of financial literacy in Kazakhstan. Consultations also pointed to the importance of conducting a needs assessment of SMEs' business development and review the design of dedicated state programs in support of SME and entrepreneurship development.The proposed support is consistent with lessons learned from previous lending and non-lending support to Kazakhstan's finance sector, including three loans provided by ADB facilitating of SME lending through the local Damu fund, and a receint technical assistance preparing for a new $220 million loan providing financial support to micro and SMEs also through the Damu fund, which point to the need for improving financial literacy and DFS. The independent validation of the final review of ADB's previous strategy (2012-2016) recommended that ADB should broaden its involvement with micro and SMEs beyond providing credit line to addressing supply- and demand-side constrains to SME development. Suggestions included the importance of strengthening the enabling environment for entrepreneurship and SME development and to foster the capacity of LFIs and SMEs. The validation further recommended that ADB should make efforts to support enterprises at sector's lower segment to increase the scale and depth of outreach.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/51406-001/main,05 Feb 2018,225000.0,1,2018,Finance,No

Regional,Regional,Strengthening Asia's Financial Safety Nets and Resolution Mechanisms,"The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will address the issue of nonperforming loans (NPLs) in Asia and the Pacific region by supporting the development of a national strategy and a market for NPLs or distressed assets through research and capacity building. This will be coupled with knowledge sharing through Annual Summit Meetings and Conferences of the International Public Asset Management Company Forum (IPAF), as well as training workshops to build the capacity of public asset management companies (AMCs), deposit insurance institutions, and other invited regional participants to manage distressed assets. The TA supports Regional Cooperation and Integration (RCI), a key strategic agenda under Strategy 2020. This TA will also contribute to the third strategic pillar of the RCI Strategy, 2006 the development, deepening, and harmonization of regional financial marketsby supporting regional forums and regional macroeconomic and financial stability through research and information dissemination, capacity building, and institutional strengthening and partnership. The TA project's purpose is also aligned with the Financial Sector Operational Plan, 2011 and the plan's mid-term review, 2017 by supporting banks and nonbank financial institutions, and investing in NPL resolution and AMCs. It is also aligned with the RCI Operational Plan, 2016 in helping developing member countries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) harness increased benefits through improved cooperation and integration and by strengthening ADB's institutional capacity to encourage RCI through a larger, more innovative portfolio. The TA's impact would be: Regional financial stability and resilience in Asia strengthened through the design of NPL resolution mechanisms and development of NPL or distressed asset markets (as defined by the TA).Its outcome would be: Strategies identified and developed for national NPL resolution mechanisms and the development of NPL or distressed asset markets in emerging Asia. It has the following four major outputs:(i) Knowledge Shared through Annual Summit Meetings and Conferences. The IPAF conducts annual summit meetings and conferences among its members, joined by public and private sector experts and policy makers to share knowledge and experiences in NPL resolution and debt restructuring. IPAF members also meet frequently to discuss strategies for NPL resolution and the development of NPL or distressed asset markets as well as concrete action plans. In addition to resolution mechanisms, the members may also identify financial infrastructure conditions that could lead to a surge in NPLs, either to preempt such a situation or to provide solutions when NPLs become a concern. These meetings benefit DMCs by promoting awareness and the adoption of a national strategy and potential mechanisms for NPL resolution appropriate to each country's economic and financial environments. ADB and the IPAF chair will jointly organize and host the annual IPAF summits, at which participants will discuss strategic directions for the IPAF in the succeeding years, and progress will be monitored and evaluated based on the IPAF charter and on this TA's Design and Monitoring Framework.(ii) Research Undertaken. This TA will produce major research papers and case studies on successes and failures in dealing with distressed assets in the region, and explore ways to strengthen Asia's financial safety nets, including the buttressing of potential roles for AMCs and deposit insurance schemes, thereby addressing the issues stated in the rationale. Key research activities will include the following: (i) a study on developing NPL markets, including their prerequisites, strategies and possible modalities; (ii) a study on national and regional approaches or policy recommendations for dealing with distressed assets, focused on developing strategies to develop NPL or distressed assets market; and (iii) a study on legal and regulatory aspect of NPLs, possibly including an analysis of the debt and distressed assets of state-owned enterprises; and Asia's experience in dealing with NPLs, including financial supervision and market development compared to approaches of other regions. These research findings will be presented in conferences and seminars, in collaboration with the Finance Sector Group to reach as many finance sector professionals in ADB as possible. These findings will inform country partnership strategies and country operations business plans for DMCs, as well as operations departments' engagements with the public sector and private sector institutions dealing with financial stability. The findings will be published and disseminated through knowledge sharing events.(iii) Training Workshops Conducted. One training program will be conducted each year during 20182020 to build the capacity of financial authorities, public AMCs, deposit insurance institutions, and other invited participants to manage distressed assets. It is critical for AMCs with advanced skills in distressed asset management and financial strength to share their knowledge and experiences with new AMCs in the region. This will help AMCs expand operations outside their home bases, creating win-win value and promoting regional skills transfer.(iv) International Public Asset Management Company Forum Promotion and Expansion Effected through Website Management. The IPAF will continue to provide members with online access to relevant data and information, research papers, reference materials, training schedules, and networking data through continued management of the IPAF website.",Active,http://www.adb.org/projects/51118-001/main,29 Jan 2018,250000.0,1,2018,Finance,No

The TA cluster will focus on the external constraints that have been identified and will also demonstrate new ways of engaging with civil society through operationalizing ongoing improvements in ADB's internal business processes (internal constraints). The TA cluster will contribute to the improved delivery of inclusive development services in selected DMCs, in support of the SDGs, by contributing to stronger CSO participation in ADB operations. The three outputs of the TA cluster are:  Output 1: Capacity for effective CSO engagement in the design, implementation, and monitoring of ADB projects improved. Output 2: Demonstration activities through effective CSO engagement conducted. Output 3: Knowledge products about effective CSO engagement in ADB operations generated and shared.Subproject 1 (SP1) is the first of three subprojects planned under the TA cluster. SP1 will focus on selected countries in three ADB regional departments: East Asia Department (EARD), Central and West Asia Department (CWRD), and Pacific Department (PARD). Subproject 2 (SP2) will expand the TA activities into selected countries in the South Asia Department (SARD) and Southeast Asia Department (SERD), plus additional countries in PARD, while Subproject 3 (SP3) will upscale and expand ongoing activities under SP1 and SP2. The TA cluster approach allows for a staging of complementary activities, bundled under subprojects and sequenced to allow for adequate planning and design of activities, mobilization of resources, and scheduling of funding. The TA cluster approach also allows for flexible upscaling of successful outputs and alignment of donor funding with subproject design. The three subprojects are envisioned to deliver activities and outputs individually, which will contribute to the above TA cluster outputs, and will collectively strengthen and enhance the likelihood of achieving desired performance targets as outlined in the design and monitoring framework. SP1 will support a range of activities to address the external barriers, by building the knowledge and skills of government and CSOs to cooperate and establish collective objectives through ADB-financed programs and projects. The first subproject will initiate the project and lay the groundwork for subprojects 2 and 3. SP1 will focus on selected countries in three regional departments, namely: CWRD, EARD, and PARD. In particular the focus countries will be Georgia (CWRD), and Mongolia (EARD). A regional approach will be adopted in PARD by identifying key projects as points of entry. Activities will focus in these countries and region, but the subproject will not necessarily exclude any other ADB member countries. SP1 supports the three outputs of the TA cluster. It will undertake a participatory design of the enhanced CSO engagement program and commence implementation of in-country capacity building and CSO engagement programs for Year 1 of the implementation period.SP1 will also complement ADB's ongoing internal initiatives, including those launched under MTR-AP which aims to address barriers to achieving higher levels of CSO engagement in ADB operations. The barriers include ADB's own business processes and procedures which are insufficient to stimulate higher levels of CSO engagement, limited incentives to engage CSOs, the need to strengthen the ADB's CSO Cooperation Network comprising of bankwide CSO focal persons under regional departments, and the knowledge and experience of staff which may constrain the quality of CSO engagement especially at the design stage of projects. SP1 will also help prepare the initial design for SP2 under the TA cluster. This includes initial planning and designs for SARD and SERD pilot countries for SP2, and seeking additional funding for full implementation of SP2 and SP3. SP1 will explore innovative ways to upscale partnerships and demonstrate CSO engagement, one of which will be through mobilizing other funding sources.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/50364-002/main,20 Dec 2017,400000.0,1,2017,Public sector management,No

Pakistan,Central and West Asia,Punjab Intermediate Cities Improvement Investment Project (Phase 2),"Pakistan's rate of urbanization is unprecedented, where cumulatively the population of its cities has expanded by over 70% during the past 2 decades alone. As a result, its cities have and continue to experience relentless urban densification and expansion, resulting in ever-increasing demand for urban services and growing pressures on urban service institutions to deliver. This situation has become acute in many cities, and especially Pakistan's intermediate cities, where urban delivery institutions are increasingly unable to cope, resulting in significant environmental degradation, unhealthy public spaces, and a severe shortage of civic amenities. The classic hallmarks of strained urban development are apparent in many cities, including unplanned and overcrowded settlements and residential areas, traffic-clogged streets and arterials, irregular and poor quality water supplies, and serious environmental and public health impacts caused by poorly functioning liquid and solid waste management systems.Fully recognizing livable cities as engines of economic growth and centers of culture and knowledge, the government has now placed urban sector development as a key priority of its national strategic development agenda. It has also amended the constitution to decentralize urban services, paving the way to build stronger institutional capacity in municipal governments so that they can respond more rapidly and effectively to the growing needs of individual cities as they evolve. So far, urban sector reforms have included selected cities of Punjab, which is Pakistan's most populous province and generates half of the nation's gross domestic product. In this context, the Government of Punjab (GOP), through the support of its Urban Unit, has and continues to implement key urban sector reform initiatives in selected areas throughout the province, working closely with international development partners to upgrade and expand urban infrastructure, and reform and build capacity in infrastructure service delivery institutions. This has notably included support from the World Bank, which has provided assistance to five large cities of Punjab, and more recently from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) through PICIIP (Phase 1).",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/51215-002/main,15 Dec 2017,225000.0,1,2017,Water and other urban infrastructure and services,No

Sri Lanka,South Asia,Mahaweli Water Security Investment Program - Tranche 2,"The Mahaweli Water Security Investment Program (the investment program) will accelerate the economic activities of Sri Lanka's northern dry zone region by transferring surplus water from the Mahaweli river basin for irrigation, drinking and commercial purposes. It will develop bulk water conveyance and storage infrastructure planned under the North Central Province Canal Program (NCPCP), a high priority program of the government that will support completion of the Mahaweli Development Program (MDP), which started in 1973.Key components of the MDP were completed in the 1980s, notably several irrigation systems and large dams for hydropower; however, the planned components for water transfers to the northern dry zone were not implemented largely because of the prolonged conflict. After the conflict ended in 2009, the government prioritized completion of the MDP by initiating the NCPCP. The investment program supports the government's sector objective of ensuring water availability to water users, providing water in adequate quantities with improved management, enhancing productivity and water user efficiency, and addressing the spatial variation of water availability, climate change and disaster vulnerability, as described in the Public Investment Programme 2017-2020. The outcome will be access to water resources for agricultural and drinking purposes in project areas secured. ADB and the government signed the financing framework agreement (FFA) for the investment program on 23 April 2015. On 24 June 2015, the Board approved the provision of loans to Sri Lanka under a multitranche financing facility (MFF) of up to $453 million equivalent to be implemented between July 2015 and December 2024.

Kazakhstan,Central and West Asia,Establishment of the Kazakhstan Knowledge Center on Integrated Water Resources Management,"Since Kazakhstan declared independence from the former Soviet Union in 1991, the country's water sector has been incapable to attract adequate knowledge and financial resources. Today, water-related infrastructures are unable to effectively serve the needs of the population in terms of drinking water supply and sanitation in rural areas as well as in a number of urban areas; Kazakhstan's economic diversification plans are hampered by outdated irrigation systems; and the country is struggling with climate change adaptation needs in managing floods and other natural disasters. Water-related data and information, including on the downstream use of the water resources for urban water services, is fragmented across several institutions. Currently, responsibilities for managing water-related issues in Kazakhstan is divided across six ministries, with pronounced problems in terms of institutional coordination. The absence of a comprehensive database and unified, structured system for strengthening institutional linkages creates inefficiencies and problems for the country to position itself along the water technological frontier. Kazakhstan urgently needs to update its water-related knowledge and educational structure, enhance its integrated water management systems and strengthen institutional coordination in order to contribute to enhancing the quality of water-related services to the population, improving agriculture productivity, as well as promoting food security and mitigation efforts in response to climate change. Kazakhstan's new CPS commits extensive support from ADB to the establishment of applied knowledge centers, indicating IWRM as a key area for intervention. The Ministry of Agriculture of Kazakhstan agreed to the creation of the Center as an outcome of discussions with the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and a brainstorming session held at the Kazakhstan National Agrarian University (KazNAU) on 13-14 October 2017 among international organizations and national agencies forming the informal Water Partners Group of Kazakhstan (WPGK).",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/51364-001/main,11 Dec 2017,225000.0,1,2017,"Agriculture, natural resources and rural development",Yes

Indonesia,South East Asia,Sustainable Energy Access in Eastern Indonesia-Electricity Grid Development Program,"The proposed $600 million result-based loan (RBL) program aims to support the development of electricity distribution networks to connect businesses and households and to enhance the quality of life in Eastern Indonesia by the sustainable use of electricity as a key driver of increased economic activity. The program will complement a proposed sector loan for small- to mid-sized natural gas-fired power stations to deliver more sustainable energy services to communities across Eastern Indonesia. Natural gas is a much cleaner fuel compared to diesel and the quick-responding nature of gas-fired engines and turbines make them a good match for intermittent renewable energy sources such as solar and wind. It is an appropriate transition fuel to move towards a low-carbon energy system. The two loans will help enhance access to sustainable energy services and contribute to climate change mitigation. The overall investment needs for the government's generation, transmission, and distribution program are $83.5 billion of which $43.5 billion is to come from the private sector (independent power producers) and the balance of $40 billion from the State Electricity Corporation (Perusahaan Listrik Negara or PLN). The government and PLN will not be able to meet the investment needs on their own. PLN has an estimated funding gap of $30.3 billion which will have to be borne by other financing sources including from development partners. In Eastern Indonesia where there are many isolated grids, PLN is already using its own resources to establish 70 kilovolt (kV) and 150 kV backbone transmission systems while seeking support from ADB and other partners to strengthen and expand local distribution networks.A results-based lending modality will be used for this proposed operation. This will finance a slice of the overall broader program needs as identified in PLN's Electric Power Supply Business Plan (Rencana Usaha Penyediaan Tenaga Listrik or RUPTL) 2015-2024 for grid development in Eastern Indonesia. 8.A results-based lending modality will be used for this proposed operation for strengthening and developing the electricity distribution network, which involves many small-scale activities and expenditures. This will finance a slice of the overall broader program needs as identified in PLN's RUPTL, 20162025 for grid development in Eastern Indonesia. The RBL is a suitable modality for the program as: (i) it allows PLN to use its own program systems, thus providing a platform for institutional strengthening; (ii) it focuses attention on results rather than expenditures, leading to a stronger evaluation culture and in line with the government's intent to move towards performance-based regulation; (iii) it is well-aligned to a broader nationwide PLN program and is, therefore, able to scale up innovations from the RBL program; (iv) it has lower transaction costs associated with program implementation; and (v) it could stimulate cofinancing and donor harmonization with other development partners through a focus on common results. This operation is part of an overall programmatic approach and is embedded within a policy reform framework that is supported by the Sustainable and Inclusive Energy Program policy-based loan and complements the ongoing RBL for grid strengthening in Sumatra. This RBL is included in the Country Operations Business Plan, 2015-2017 and is integral to the Country Partnership Strategy's goal of closing the energy divide between Western and Eastern Indonesia.",Active,http://www.adb.org/projects/50016-001/main,14 Dec 2017,583740000.0,1,2017,Energy,Yes

Kazakhstan,Central and West Asia,Samruk-Energy Green Transformation,"Samruk-Energy is the largest electricity generation company in Kazakhstan with approximately 7,000 megawatts (MW) of installed capacity. Samruk-Energy is one of the seven SOEs owned by Samruk Kazyna and planned for IPOs. In preparation for the IPO, Samruk-Energy is implementing a comprehensive corporate transformation program, which includes sales of nine of its assets, improvements to corporate governance, an introduction of enterprise resource planning system, etc. Following the government's development goals, in 2015 Samruk-Energy adopted the Long-term Development Strategy 2015 2025. Among other things, by 2025 Samruk-Energy plans to increase the power generation capacity from renewable sources up to 10% of total installed capacity (850 MW), which presently is less than 1%. In this context, Samruk-Energy has requested ADB to provide a technical assistance to support its corporate transformation and balance sheet restructuring planning. In addition to the corporate transformation to improve operation efficiency, Samruk-Energy faces liquidity requirements of EUR500 million by mid December 2017. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) signed a loan agreement with Samruk-Energy in May 2017 for a EUR100 million loan to support its restructuring. While Samruk-Energy indicates that it would be able to raise the remaining amount from other financing sources, these will largely be from local banks, which will have limited tenors and continue to create challenges in managing Samruk-Energy's cash flow. The TA will have three major outputs: (i) a report on Samruk-Energy's corporate transformation program, including the assessment of the activities and their impact on the energy sector and the whole economy of Kazakhstan and recommendations; (ii) detailed historical and pro-forma financial analysis of Samruk-Energy with a financial model to support the analysis and planning of balance sheet restructuring; and (iii) an environmental and social safeguard audit of Samruk-Energy's current environmental and social management system (ESMS) with recommendations to fill any gaps to meet international standards.

Nepal,South Asia,Power Transmission and Distribution Efficiency Enhancement Project,"Electricity is a necessary requirement for accelerating the economic development of any country and is considered an important input to improve quality of life. Overall, the electricity demand has far outgrown the supply, leading to load curtailment and increased dependence on imports from India in recent times. The peak suppressed demand in Nepal in FY20132014 has been around 1,200 megawatt (MW) as against installed capacity of 787 MW, hence resulting in a deficit of about 440 MW due to non-availability of generation. Government has plans to generate additional 10,000 MW in the next 10 years. About 63% of the population in Nepal has access to electricity but the supply quality is unreliable and inadequate. The government has recognized the immediate need for reinforcement and upgrade of outdated distribution systems crucial to deliver the required energy to the customers even if the generation and transmission lines are in place. In this regard, the need for immediate distribution network enhancement is included in the government's action plan to address energy crisis and provide universal access to reliable and efficient electricity for all by 2030. This will contribute in promoting sustainable energy for all (Sustainable Development Goal #7) and Nepal's Intended Nationally Determined Commitments for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.ADB's Nepal country partnership strategy 20132017 supports the government's development objective of accelerated and inclusive economic growth. It seeks to address the infrastructure bottlenecks in the key areas such as energy services and creating an enabling environment for increased business and employment opportunities.

Tonga,The Pacific,Integrated Urban Resilience Sector Project,"Development pressure in Tonga's capital, Nuku'alofa, is increasing as a result of population growth and further investment in sustainable urban infrastructure is required, with particular focus on building disaster and climate change resilience. Land for urban expansion of Nuku'alofa is limited to peripheral agricultural and ecologically sensitive areas, placing development pressure on existing marginal areas within Nuku'alofa such as Sopu and Popua, which are low lying, subject to frequent flooding during periods of heavy rain and storm surge, and have significant numbers of poor households.The geographical, geological and socioeconomic features of Tonga class it as one of the countries most at risk to the adverse impacts of climate change. The current and future climate-related drivers of risk for Tonga and, in particular, for Nuku'alofa, include sea level rise, tropical cyclones, increasing air and sea surface temperatures, and changing rainfall patterns. Nuku'alofa, and particularly the low-lying areas of Sopu and Popua, are highly vulnerable to climate change and suffer from recurrent flooding events, resulting in (i) personal and economic losses, (ii) flood damage to property and infrastructure, (ii) perpetual standing water, (iii) ideal conditions for mosquitoes and the transmission of waterborne diseases, and (iv) loss of access to properties.Flooding in Nuku'alofa remains an unaddressed issue. Development of Sopu and Popua is constrained by large swamps, requiring substantial filling to enable properties to be developed. Many lots within Sopu and Popua have not been developed or registered, as households are unable to fill their properties to a habitable level above seasonal flood levels. Additionally, the effects of extreme weather events, exacerbated by climate change, are worsening the situation. The piecemeal raising of road levels and filling of residential land to cope with the floods on an individual basis has altered the natural drainage patterns and created additional swamps and open water bodies. Lack of institutional arrangements and responsibilities for the provision of drainage services (new drainage and maintenance of existing ones) and the lack of legislation and regulations have contributed to limited drainage improvements and resultant marginal living conditions in Sopu and Popua where households facing financial hardship are over-represented. Improvements to Nuku'alofa's water supply system provided through the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Government of Australia funded Nuku'alofa Urban Development Sector Project (NUDSP) are yielding positive results in terms of operation, water pressures, water security and financial performance of the state-owned Tonga Water Board (TWB). However, although the improvements and accomplishments have been substantial, TWB is also facing several serious constraints:(i) Effective management and protection of its new additional water resources is not in place, which puts its recent investments in additional production capacity at risk. (ii) People do not like the water supplied by TWB because it is _hard _ water and prefers to drink softer water from uncontrolled sources, which may create public health issues.(iii) The improved water supply pressures have resulted in higher water losses due to leakage, increasing the percentage of non-revenue water, which is now estimated at about 40% to 50% of production (up from 30% in 2011).(iv) Adequate asset management is lacking, resulting in inadequate maintenance and lack of maintenance budget.(v) System components in TWB's outer island operations need upgrading or rehabilitation.(vi) Billing efficiency and metering are improving but still below acceptable standards.(vii) An agreed framework and policy for setting water tariffs does not exist, creating uncertainty and ad-hoc changes in TWB's revenues.(viii) The cooperation between TWB, Tonga Power Limited, and Waste Authority Limited (WAL) is intensifying under the new government-initiated shared Board, but guidance is needed on the way forward. There is a lack of capacity in fields such as project management, technical planning, technical skills, human resource planning, and the organisation needs to improve its professional image.The current NUDSP will pilot new on-site sewage treatment and disposal facilities to selected households in Nuku'alofa. However, further investment in improved on-site sewage treatment and disposal facilities for an additional 400 households is necessary and would enhance public and environmental health in Nuku'alofa, particularly in low lying areas, such as Sopu and Popua, where the high water table and chronic flooding render on-site sewage treatment and disposal a high health risk to residents.Additionally, the Cabinet has recently approved WAL to be responsible for waste management services nationwide. In order to fulfill its new obligations, WAL requires additional capacity building support (technical trainings on waste management operations, maintenance, training of trainers etc) and investment support to purchase additional equipment to run the waste management operations in Tongatapu and the outer islands. .",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/49455-001/main,27 Jun 2017,675000.0,1,2017,Water and other urban infrastructure and services,Yes

People's Republic of China,East Asia,Creating Enabling Environments for Gradual Rural-Urban Migration and Urban Settlements Development in Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture,"The integration of rural migrants in urban areas as permanent urban residents is one of the priorities to achieve _people-oriented urbanization_ as set forth in the National Plan on New Urbanization (2014 -2020) and the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016- 2020. This priority reflects that the PRC lags behind in urbanization, compared to developed countries when they attained per capita incomes similar to the PRC. In 2014, the PRC's urbanization rate was 54.8%. However, when rural migrants in urban areas without urban hukou (household registration) were discounted, the urbanization rate was only 36.7%. The majority of rural migrants - about 236 million in 2013, predominantly males and single females in their 20s or 30s - reside in urban areas in the short term (less than 6 months) or long term (more than 6 months) without becoming permanent urban residents (with urban hukou), while leaving married women, children, and the elderly in their home villages. Against this background, the the PRC Government aims to (i) grant urban residencies to about 100 million rural migrants living in urban areas with rural hukou, (ii) rebuild urban villages for another 100 million people, and (iii) develop small towns and cities for 100 million more people in the poor central and western regions during the plan period 2016 -2020.  Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture, located in central Yunnan Province, forms part of the PRC's poverty-stricken western region. It is the home of several ethnic minority groups (the largest is the Yi), which in 2015 accounted for more than 35% of the population. The prefecture is mountainous, with only 8.3% of the land area classified as flatland. It is prone to natural hazards such as landslides and floods, which severely hit poor rural areas. The per capita income of rural households in the prefecture was CNY8,327 in 2015, barely one-third of that of urban households (CNY26,763), and well below the rural per capita income at the national level (CNY11,422). Because of its sociogeographic characteristics and poor transport infrastructure, which are also common to other poor prefectures in the PRC''s central and western regions, the prefecture lags in economic development and industrialization, which negatively affects the urbanization rate (40.4% in 2015, lower than Yunnan Province [43.3%] and the PRC [56.1%]). Even labor-intensive, resource-based manufacturing with low entry barriers remains underdeveloped and has generated little stable employment for rural migrants. The prefecture is, therefore, trapped in a vicious circle low industrialization leads to slow rural urban migration and urbanization and, consequently, slow progress in poverty reduction.  In 2010, the Chuxiong Prefecture Government''s Policy Research and Legislative Advisory Office conducted a study to develop policy recommendations promoting gradual migration of the rural population to urban areas: first, rural -rural migration from mountainous areas to semi-mountainous and flatland areas; second, rural -urban migration without the change of household registration (long-term rural migrants in urban areas); and third, rural -urban migration with the change of household registration (permanent urban residents). Some of the recommendations were incorporated in the prefecture government plan documents, such as the Chuxiong Prefecture New Type Urbanization Plan, 2014 -2020, and the Chuxiong Prefecture Rural Poverty Reduction Plan, 2011- 2020. The study also had impacts beyond Chuxiong, providing a reference for other similar prefectures in the central and western regions. Since the study, however, policy and economic environments have changed, requiring a new study of rural migrants and returnees.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/49279-001/main,19 Dec 2016,400000.0,1,2016,Industry and trade,Yes

Regional,Regional,Pacific Renewable Energy Investment Facility (formerly Pacific Renewable Energy Investment Program),"Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are heavily dependent on diesel for power generation, which has resulted in high electricity tariffs. The average supply cost for electricity across the Pacific is $0.47/kilo-watt hour (kWh), which is high by international standards. However, this increases significantly for the smaller, more isolated SIDS where the high cost of electricity is negatively impacting economic growth. Over reliance on imported fuel also depletes limited foreign reserves and exposes the SIDS economies to diesel price spikes. The investment program will target seven of the smaller Pacific SIDS with a combined population of around 500,000. All targeted SIDS have populations less than 200,000, with four less than 55,000.Pacific SIDS have recognized the need to structurally shift power generation from diesel to renewable energy and all have aggressive national renewable energy targets, in some cases of up to 100%. While the seven target SIDS are endowed with cost-competitive renewable energy resources, lack of access to adequate funding has limited the uptake of renewable energy, and most SIDS have been unable to secure sufficient funding to significantly increase the renewable energy share of generation. In order to fill the financing gap, Pacific SIDS are encouraging private sector in the form of independent power providers (IPPs) to invest in the sector, however there are significant barriers to entry of the private sector. Additionally, SIDS face significant capacity barriers to plan, design, implement and manage renewable energy investments. Ongoing sector reform is required to encourage the structural shift to renewable energy. In general, Pacific SIDS are not currently on track to meet their aggressive renewable energy targets. If all proposed renewable energy projects with secure financing in the target SIDS are constructed, two SIDS would have over 40% renewable energy, however 4 of 8 would still only have less than 5% renewable energy.",Active,http://www.adb.org/projects/49450-001/main,24 Nov 2016,5000000.0,1,2016,Energy,Yes

It is expected that all 23 economies that were part of ICP 2011 will also be part of the next ICP round._To estimate the PPPs, the ICP requires undertaking price collection surveys of a large number of household and non-household consumption items that are comparable based on structured product descriptions (SPDs) across participating economies, and a breakdown of the national gross domestic product into detailed expenditure categories per the ICP classification of goods and services. The UN Statistical Commission also recommended adopting gradually a flexible 'rolling benchmark_ approach for estimating the PPPs, with price collection surveys spread over a cycle of three-years starting from the 2017 comparison. It has also recommended exploring a closer alignment of the ICP and Consumer Price Index (CPI) surveys in order to reduce the burden on countries, and to enhance the quality of price statistics in general and linking the ICP capacity building activities to efforts to enhance statistical capacity for monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).The Asian Development Bank (ADB) through the Development Economics and Indicators Division (ERDI) of the Economics Research and Regional Cooperation Department (ERCD) has been the regional coordinator of the ICP in Asia and the Pacific region since 2003._As regional coordinator, the ADB has successfully coordinated the 2005 and 2011 benchmark rounds of the ICP. ADB-ERCD's work has been recognized by all partners as critical to the success of the ICP. Hence, there is demand from all stakeholders for ADB-ERCD to continue playing the role of regional coordinator for the Asia Pacific region._Continued engagement in the ICP has been enabling the ERDI to continue its collaborative statistical work with national and international organizations (the national statistical offices and the World Bank in particular). Regional coordination has also helped ERDI integrate its initiatives in improving the statistical capacity (in surveys, data processing and analysis of price statistics and national accounts, and related fields) in ADB developing member economies (DMEs)._As such, the next ICP round provides a unique opportunity for ADB to continue its efforts toward strengthening the statistical capacity of DME's national statistical offices in collecting and examining ICP price data; to facilitate collective efforts of all participating DMEs to improve methods for data collection, and to increase the reliability and availability of PPPs and national accounts expenditure estimates for better and informed policy-making.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/50233-001/main,24 Nov 2016,2500000.0,1,2016,Public sector management,No

People's Republic of China,East Asia,Qingdao Rural Waste-to-Energy Project,"In rural Shandong Province, straw and coal are traditional fuel for heating and cooking. They are burned in inefficient heating and cooking stoves, which poses serious indoor and outdoor air pollution and emission of carbon dioxide. Over the decades, the Government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) provided large amount of financial support to promote comprehensive utilization of agricultural and livestock waste in rural areas such as setting up household based biogas digesters, small scale biomass heating boilers, and conversion of agricultural waste to pellet fuel which are operated by farmers or small enterprises. Household based bio digesters have shown good results in terms of economy and technology. However, household biogas digester often cannot produce enough gas in the middle of winter due to lack of feed stock, which compels rural people to use coal for heating. Establishing medium and large scale livestock industry based biogas plants were actively promoted during the Twelfth Five-Year Plan of the PRC (2011-2015), however there were mixed success in biogas production due to poor design of plants and lack of human capacity in operation of the plants. Moreover, the current practice of biomass briquette production involves low level of mechanization in the process and poor quality of equipment causing low quality of pellet fuel. To overcome these issues, a new policy is being issued under the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan (2016-2020) of the PRC to encourage large energy service providers, such as national level power generation companies, and municipal state-owned gas and heating services providers, entering to rural energy market and exploit untapped biomass to energy. Consistent with this, the proposed project will demonstrate a comprehensive utilization of agricultural and livestock waste to energy for heating and cooking in 60 new rural communities in rural Qingdao to be implemented and operated by the Qingdao Energy Group (QEG), the largest local state-owned energy company in Qingdao, thereby improving the quality of energy access, and reducing air, soil, and water pollution in rural areas. The proposed project will not only directly benefit about 660,000 people in the project area (20% of total rural population in project area), but indirectly benefit the residents of the other parts of Qingdao by removing some of the sources of pollution now emanating from the project area.The project will complement Asian Development Bank (ADB)-financed Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) Clean Air Program. Upon project completion, similar technical application and business model can be replicated in other similar rural areas in the greater BTH region by turning agricultural and livestock wastes to cleaner and low-carbon heating and cooking fuel. During the project preparation, ADB will facilitate establishing a knowledge and technical exchange platform between the QEG and advanced countries in using biogas and biomass such as Germany, Japan, Sweden, and the United States. This will help Qingdao gain further knowledge and experience in the areas of (i) policies, institutional laws and regulations; (ii) biogas and biomass technologies; and (iii) relevant project experiences.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/50089-001/main,01 Nov 2016,500000.0,0,2016,Energy,Yes

Being both oligotrophic (nutrient-poor) and endorheic (lacking conventional outflows), the lake is extremely sensitive to elevated nutrient and contaminant inflows. Unchecked, it is therefore increasingly vulnerable to excessive liquid and solid waste pollution from the expanding human activity.2. Cholpon-Ata, a small town on the lake s northern shoreline, highlights these concerns. Although enjoying the benefits of a flourishing tourism industry, with over 238,000 tourist visits in 2012, its environmental pollution and subsequent public health risk potential is an increasing concern due its dilapidated sewerage network, treatment facilities, and undeveloped solid waste management system. Reflecting other lakeshore towns and settlements, it emphasizes the crucial need for environmental infrastructure improvements in order to protect and sustain the lake and surrounding areas.3. The government of the Kyrgyz Republic has recognized the significant environmental and natural resource values of the Issyk-Kul region, and is committed to ensuring its long-term environmental sustainability. As a result, it has adopted the National Sustainable Development Strategy for the Kyrgyz Republic for the Period 2013-2017, which establishes tourism as a key pillar of economic development while specifically mentioning the Issyk-Kul region in the context of national development.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/50176-001/main,14 Oct 2016,800000.0,0,2016,Water and other urban infrastructure and services,Yes

Nepal,South Asia,Strengthening Subnational Public Management,"The Constitution of Nepal has introduced fiscal federalism, giving powers to all three levels of government to enact laws, prepare budgets, impose taxes, and collect own-source revenues. A critical aspect of fiscal decentralization is that the provincial and local governments have revenue-raising powers through taxation. To improve the subnational revenue mobilization, the government needs to undertake a thorough assessment of (i) the revenue generation potential of subnational governments; (ii) appropriate tax policies, including the design of acts, codes, and procedural manuals for local government taxes based on the ability to pay the principle; and (iii) requirements to expand tax administration systems that are based on information and communication technology (such as a municipal administration and revenue system) to streamline tax administration and collection, and link such systems with broader governance, PFM, and anticorruption objectives. The new Constitution also recognizes the need to address the vertical and horizontal imbalances among federal, provincial, and local levels of government. A permanent constitutional body, the National Natural Resources and Fiscal Commission, has been proposed to determine the appropriate levels of fiscal transfers and revenue distribution among the three government tiers, and recommend equalization grants. It is critical to assist the government to (i) establish the commission with a clear institutional structure, function, and mandate; and (ii) provide the necessary technical and capacity building support, specifically in relation to principles of intergovernmental fiscal transfers, including the design of a devolution formula. Another important dimension of fiscal decentralization is the establishment of a suitable framework and mechanism for onlending to subnational governments. To maintain overall fiscal discipline, the framework must have clear terms and conditions; enforceable rules, regulations, and procedures for onlending to subnational governments and repayment; and obligations and responsibilities between the central and subnational governments. For improving transparency in PFM and reducing fiduciary risks at the subnational level, there is a need to strengthen (i) integrated financial management; (ii) accounting and reporting systems; (iii) electronic government procurement (e-GP) system, including the nationwide roll-out; and (iv) internal, external, and technical audit systems by building on and deepening the reforms of SPMP I.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/36172-064/main,01 Sep 2016,500000.0,0,2016,Public sector management,No

At the same time, the city faces (i) an arid climate (almost no rainfall), (ii) dependency on constrained water resources, and (iii) an encroaching desert. The boundaries for urban expansion, limited by the desert, lead to intensified urban development. Hetian (also known as Hotan) has a long history as an oasis town on the Southern silk route and is renowned for its jade and carpets. Traditionally isolated, a planned railway linkage from Golmud, Qinghai, through Hetian and Kashi, to South and Central Asia, will increase growth pressures.

People's Republic of China,East Asia,Facility for Strengthening Policy Reform and Capacity Building,"Though the People''s Republic of China (PRC) has made considerable progress in overall economic growth in the past three decades, the country still has a long way to reach a moderately prosperous and harmonious society (xiao kang) by 2020. Excessive reliance on investment, exports and industrial development in the past have created imbalances and structural constraints such as low factor productivity resulting from overinvestment and excess capacity, growing income and regional disparities, and environmental concerns. This has led the government to question the soundness of the growth model. Under the 'new normal which focuses on quality rather than quantity of economic growth, the PRC economy is facing numerous challenges: declining factor productivity; widening income inequality; increasing urban and rural gap; environmental degradation and pollution; resource constraints; economic rebalancing; downside of urbanization; weak institutional capacity; poor policy coordination among government agencies; and above all the need to shape its institutions from economic growth-led to public service-oriented to respond to new and emerging challenges. The PRC''s 13th Five Year Plan (FYP) 2016-2020 was approved by the National People's Congress in March 2016. The plan outlines a policy framework, as well as priorities and economic and social development targets, including medium-high economic growth; innovation-driven development; ecological civilization and green development; and inclusive development and building a modern social sector, among others.The proposed TA is the eighth one of the facility-type TA series . The creation and evolution of facility-type TA by EARD has provided an important tool that enhances ADB's ability to quickly and flexibly respond to emerging policy and capacity building issues. It is also an important means to support and disseminate innovation serving different objectives of Country Partnership Strategy and the PRC reform priorities. The evolution of facility-type TAs as a vehicle for delivering 'just in time knowledge has been noted and is being replicated in other developing member countries (DMCs). To date, only TA 8780 of the approved seven facility-type TA projects is ongoing and its funds are already fully committed. However, continuing policy recommendations and capacity building are in critical need for the PRC government to quickly and effectively formulate and execute policies to address the economic and social development challenges under the ""'new normal "". In addition, the implementation period of the proposed TA will coincide with the initial implementation period of the 13th FYP. This TA also supports the implementation of the recently approved PRC Country Knowledge Plan (CKP) in terms of knowledge generation and sharing. The subprojects under the completed facilitytype TAs contributed to varying degrees to the implementation of the government's priority areas identified in its five year plans; enabled policy analyses on emergent, urgent issues; and strengthened the capacity of the executing and implementing agencies. Building on the success of and lessons learnt from past facilitytype TAs, the proposed TA will equip the PRC government with policy inputs, tools, and forum to be able to best respond to the development challenges and achievement of the targets of the 13th FYP.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/50031-001/main,16 Aug 2016,800000.0,0,2016,,No

Regional,Regional,Strengthening Capacities to Design and Implement Smart Urban Infrastructure,"Between 2014 and 2050, the number of urban residents in South Asia is expected to nearly double from 472.8 million to 947.8 million. In the face of this unprecedented growth, cities throughout the region have been unable to keep pace with the growing demands of urban populations, significantly lagging in the delivery of basic services (water supply, sanitation, storm-water drainage, and urban transport). Key reasons include the region's urban infrastructure ecosystem of stakeholders comprising local, state, and central governments, private sector (consultants and contractors), and academic institutions constrained by weak capacities and poor coordination in the planning, design, and implementation of projects. There is limited exposure to various innovations and good practices in the sector, resulting in continuation of business-as-usual approaches which are limiting improvements in effective infrastructure development and service delivery including effective response to the risks associated with the changing climate. The result is persistent slow progress in achieving key development indicators and improvements in urban livability throughout the region. Asian Development Bank's (ADB's) Strategy 2020 emphasized the need for capacity building and institutional strengthening for inclusive and sustainable urban service delivery in the region. ADB's Urban Operational Plan (2012-2020) similarly highlights the need to strengthen local capacity building on existing systems to undertake integrated urban development, operationalized both through projects and the establishment of networks for peer-to-peer learning and sharing of best practices among cities.

Regional,Regional,Conducting Procurement Risk Assessment for Improved Procurement Outcomes,"The quality of procurement systems varies significantly across developing member countries (DMCs), and across sectors and agencies within each DMC. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been providing resources and technical assistance to support various government reform programs, and several DMCs have managed to hurdle the first generation of public procurement reforms through the enactment of procurement laws and the establishment of relevant national institutions. However, the achievement of policy and institutional reforms at the national level does not automatically translate to more effective procurement outcomes at the line agency level. This is evident from the fact that the procurement capacity assessment that ADB regularly conducts for project loans generally show capacity constraints in the area of procurement, regardless of whether of not the executing agencies (EAs) and implementing agencies (IAs) involved have handled ADB-financed projects in the past. It is therefore important to identify strengths, risks and bottlenecks that hamper the flow of reforms at the national level to EAs and IAs so that effective procurement practices are attained at the implementation level, and these contribute to the achievement of development outcomes. In February 2013, ADB's Procurement Governance Review (PGR) affirmed that country procurement risk assessments are needed to identify implementation risks and mitigation measures, and that every country partnership strategy (CPS) needs a country-specific procurement risk assessment to identify major risks that could affect implementation of the strategy. The proposed procurement risk assessment allows for procurement risk to be identified and determine the suitability of a DMC to use its own country systems, revise procurement review thresholds and prior review requirement.

Kazakhstan,Central and West Asia,"Joint Government of Kazakhstan and the Asian Development Bank Knowledge and Experience Exchange Program, Phase 2","The value of innovative strategic knowledge solutions and global best practices are accepted as crucial factors for socioeconomic advancement. For Kazakhstan, this is underscored in the country's Kazakhstan-2030 and Kazakhstan-2050 strategies. The country partnership strategy (CPS), 2012-2016 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) establishes demand-based knowledge products and services as important tools with which ADB can add value to Kazakhstan's development. These strategic documents highlight the need for Kazakhstan to effectively apply knowledge solutions and global best practices so as to become a more diversified, competitive, and inclusive economy and go beyond the middle income country stage.Against this background, and recognizing ADB's extensive experience in knowledge management across Asia and the Pacific, the Government of Kazakhstan (government) and ADB agreed to establish the joint Knowledge and Experience Exchange Program (KEEP) in 2013. The KEEP is designed to facilitate a range of strategic knowledge solutions and global best practices that will enable Kazakhstan to respond to current and future development opportunities and challenges in a well-informed and timely manner. The KEEP is defined in a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the government and ADB. The MOU provides the framework (outlining the objective and scope, areas of focus, implementation arrangements, and monitoring and evaluation measures) and commits the parties to share the cost of a range of knowledge and experience-sharing activities; the total budget of the KEEP is $3.0 million. The ADB's participation in the KEEP is through three technical assistance (TA) operations. ADB financing in each of these TA operations complements 50% of the government's cost share. Phase 2 with an approved budget of $1.0 million commenced in July 2015 after approval of the TA report by ADB Vice-President. The budget of a subsequent Phase 3 is equal to 1.5 million.This policy and advisory TA finances Phase 2 of the KEEP in 2015-2018. The expected outcome will be strengthened government capacity and awareness of best practices in selected areas. As part of the KEEP, this TA supports macro, sector, and thematic subprojects that enable or promote knowledge solutions, capacity development, and exchange of best practices. Due to the dynamic nature of government demand for advisory and other knowledge products and services, the government and ADB agreed that selection of subprojects and the implementation approach will be flexible so as to respond to the knowledge requests quickly and effectively.The criteria for selecting subprojects would be that the subproject (i) supports priority government policy reforms and is consistent with the country partnership strategy; (ii) is supporting the implementation of the government development strategy; (iii) is considered an emerging, urgent, and high-priority area where ADB can add the greatest value; (iv) shows evidence of strong government ownership; and (v) complements or synergizes the knowledge support of other development partners.The main outputs of the TA will fall under the categories of (i) policy and advisory and (ii) capacity development, and include analytical reports that will serve as background materials for the government's policymaking and the capacity-building and learning events.Effective coordination of the executing agency with stakeholders is important for a successful implementation of the TA. The related potential risks are (i) ineffective use of policy recommendations because of frequent turnover of officials, (ii) weak collaboration and support from all stakeholders, and (iii) unavailability of reliable and accurate data and information.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/47110-002/main,19 Aug 2015,1000000.0,0,2015,Public sector management,No

Regional,Regional,Selected Evaluation Studies for 2015,"The research and development technical assistance (TA) supports the 2015-2017 program cycle, particularly for products due from 2016. It will fund a set of evaluations from the operational (e.g., country program evaluations or validations); and knowledge (i.e., thematic and corporate evaluations, impact evaluations, topical working papers) programs of the Independent Evaluation Department (IED). The TA will also support stepped up knowledge sharing and outreach to maximize usefulness and impact of such evaluations. 1. Country assistance program evaluations and validations of country partnership strategy final reviews. This TA will fund at least one CAPE (Sri Lanka) and five validations (e.g., Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Philippines, Solomon Islands, Uzbekistan). These will evaluate ADB country support and cover ADB strategy, policy dialogue, completed and ongoing projects and TA, and ADB performance. They will provide ADB and its DMCs, with an evaluative basis for future CPSs. Sector assessments will serve as inputs to assessing ADB performance in a given sector, focusing on strategy, policy dialogue, ongoing and completed projects, and TA performance. The TA will also support validations of completed project/program completion reports to inform the larger country and sector assessments.2. Effectiveness of Safeguards Implementation Phase 2. The next phase of IED's safeguards assessment is to draw further insights (results and costs) from an in-depth field research of a purposive sample of ADB supported projects. IED will also examine the _on the ground_ effectiveness of ADB safeguards. The evaluation will examine the extent to which: (i) any potentially adverse impacts of ADB projects have been (or will likely be) avoided where possible or appropriately mitigated/minimized where avoidance has not been possible; and (ii) ADB safeguard efforts have brought about (or are likely to bring about) positive development outcomes. The study will examine the cost and benefit aspects of safeguards, look at category A and B projects, and some financial intermediary projects. Projects will be purposively selected in East Asia, Central and West Asia, South, and Southeast Asia (possibly, P.R. China, Kazakhstan, Cambodia, Sri Lanka which have more projects approved under the 2009 Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS) that are relatively advanced in implementation) regions. The study will adopt a mix-methods framework and will be informed by documentation analysis, key informant interviews, pilot economic analysis, and site inspections.3. Review of Sustainable Transport Initiatives (STI). The thematic evaluation study (TES) will examine the relevance, responsiveness, and effectiveness of ADB support to DMCs under its STI Operational Plan. It will assess ADB support in sustainable transport infrastructure and services. The TES will assess the implementation of the Operational Plan and identify good practices and draw lessons for future operations. It will cover sustainable road transport (urban and non-urban), traffic management, transport management and policies, and rail transport. The study will cover at least two regions and will focus on the (i) extent to which CPSs aimed to help the sustainability of transport infrastructure and services; (ii) extent to which countries implemented policies and regulatory framework, financial mechanisms, and capacity building activities for sustainable transport initiatives, (iii) extent to which these measures have been effective, and (iv) determinants of their success. The TES will conduct a desk review of operational documents for lending and non lending support to the sector from 2009 to 2014. Perception surveys, country case studies of selected sustainable transport projects, and key informant interviews of DMC stakeholders and development partners undertaking related work in the sector will also be conducted. 4. Additionality of Private Sector Operations. The corporate evaluation study (CES) will concentrate on the additionality provided by ADB in conjunction with its non-sovereign loans and equity investments approved since 2000. It will focus in particular on: (i) how ADB defines and encourages value addition in its PSO based on a review of pertinent corporate strategies, institutional incentives and project approval documents; (ii) to what extent it has achieved value addition based on a review of completed transactions, available evaluation reports, and feedback from project sponsors, financiers and other relevant stakeholders; and (iii) whether ADB could do more to optimize its financial and non-financial value addition in non-sovereign operations (NSO) based on feedback from private sector sponsors and financiers and a review of value addition achieved by similar multilateral financial institutions.5. Impact evaluation. The TA will support at least one impact evaluation study (IES). The IES will look at the development outcomes of select urban water supply projects in a country (possibly Viet Nam or India), depending on the availability of a well-structured and well-conducted household survey, and provide evidence of the poverty impacts of water supply interventions. The IES will use impact evaluation methods based on statistical and econometric analyses of quantitative data from household and community level surveys, both existing and to be conducted by the study. The counterfactuals will be drawn from comparable non-participants areas. For additional insights on non-quantifiable variables and study robustness, it will collect qualitative information and integrate it into the quantitative analyses.6. Evaluation research and topical working papers. The TA will support sector and/or thematic assessments that feed into or help disseminate higher-level evaluations in IED's work program. These include selective ad hoc evaluative researches (or _quick turnaround_ topical working papers) on high impact topics with strong potential implications for ADB's institutional policies and practices or of specific interest and relevance to DMCs.7. Evaluation outreach, knowledge sharing, and partnerships. IED continues to work to make its evaluation results more accessible and influential. It will disclose, disseminate, and share evaluation feedback through: (i) a soundly managed publicly available lessons database in its Evaluation Information System, (ii) outreach activities like briefings, presentations, and interactive learning events (i.e., training, seminars, and conferences) on completed major evaluations; (iii) preparation and publishing of syntheses, briefs, and occasional papers (designed to widen existing readership); and (iv) new mediums for knowledge sharing like online readers and tablets (to extend the reach of IED products).",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/48450-001/main,13 Jul 2015,2500000.0,0,2015,"Agriculture, natural resources and rural development",No

Regional,Regional,Infrastructure Public-Private Partnership Pipeline Development Support,"Project preparation is arguably the largest challenge that stands between developing countries and a sustainable pipeline of projects prepared for private participation. The objective of the proposed TA is to help developing countries better prepare infrastructure projects that can secure private sector financing and proceed to implementation. The TA will focus on preparatory due diligence work to enable infrastructure projects qualify to access funding from international or national project preparation facilities for further preparation and structuring as PPP. The TA will target developing countries in Asia and the Pacific, with priority to Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) countries.The APEC in its roadmap for supporting PPPs recognized that PPP projects need to be well-prepared and structured before they are brought to the market. Adequate due-diligence and preparation of technical, legal, financial, economic, environmental and social issues are necessary for government to assess trade-offs and select an optimal structure for the transaction that is attractive to potential private investors. To improve project readiness, it is useful for governments to develop a checklist and an administrative system that could indicate whether a project is ready to be brought out to the market. Management capacity in the government, particularly in contracting agencies, needs to be further developed to more effectively and efficiently bring projects forward to completion. For markets at an early stage of development, delivering a few good examples of successful PPP projects within a reasonable time, rather than focusing on quantity of projects, is a most effective strategy for attracting investors.The proposed TA will have two components.(i) Component 1: Provide support for diagnostics application to project preparation facilities. The TA will support the DMC government implementing government agencies in various aspects of PPP development such as project appraisal, risk assessment and risk sharing, bidding process, legal implications of PPP contracts, monitoring and management of project implementation. Criteria for choosing projects to be supported by the TA will be established. Projects with regional cooperation and integration components will be given priority. Lessons learned during project preparation will be compiled and regional and subregional knowledge sharing events will be design to disseminate these findings.(ii) Component 2: Provide project preparation support through the use of International Infrastructure Systems Support Platform. The TA will support DMC government implementing agencies in using the International Infrastructure Systems Support (IISS) platform to preparing their projects. The platform will enable implementing agencies to access an online, multi-user, secure work platform that provides guidance and templates that have been developed with strong private sector inputs to help increase the agencies' likelihood of developing well-structured projects that will attract private sector investors and contractors and increase public sector financing options, including PPPs.",Active,http://www.adb.org/projects/48350-001/main,23 Jun 2015,3750000.0,0,2015,Public sector management,No
Myanmar,South East Asia,Preparing Youth for the Workplace Sector Development Program,"[[NOTE: the final title of the project formulated with support under this technical assistance (TA) is Loan 3472: Equipping Youth for Employment Project (EYE), with pre-approval reference number 48431-003.]]Through ongoing technical assistance projects (TAs), the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has assisted the government in defining key priorities for reforming and strengthening secondary education subsector (SES) and technical and vocational education and training (TVET), including identifying core priorities for investments that are expected to be included in the National Education Strategic Plan. Additional project preparatory TA is needed to support detailed formulation for a Project suitable for ADB financing in terms of technical, financial, economic, institutional, sector policy, and safeguard dimensions, and to provide capacity development and other support to ensure a rapid start-up to Program implementation.

Kyrgyz Republic,Central and West Asia,Second Investment Climate Improvement Program (Subprogram 1),"The proposed program aims to create a more attractive climate for private sector development in the Kyrgyz Republic. It will provide budget support to implement reforms to (i) increase and diversify financial products and services that better mobilize domestic savings; (ii) increase efficient private sector participation in physical and social infrastructure; (iii) diversify exports and export markets, and foreign direct investment; and (iv) increase the transparency and efficiency of public procurement, and reduce the costs of doing business. The programmatic approach will comprise three subprograms to be implemented during 2015 -2018.The impact of the Second ICIP will be increased private sector investment. The outcome will be an improved business and investment climate in the Kyrgyz Republic. The Second ICIP will deliver four outputs through various policy actions: (i) financial deepening and access to finance increased; (ii) comprehensive public private partnership program fostered; (iii) trade and investment facilitated; and (iv) transparency and efficiency of doing business increased.Through the Second ICIP, ADB will continue to support the National Sustainable Development Strategy, 2013 -2017 in removing development constraints. Reforms listed in the policy matrix will facilitate the Kyrgyz Republic's transition to a sustainable economic development path. Budget support is necessary to finance part of the development financing needs, particularly covering the period between the introduction of reforms and the fiscal benefits resulting from the reforms. Although not used as a determinant of the program size, ADB's support can also help finance the direct and indirect fiscal costs to the government of implementing and monitoring the reforms. The government has the ability to implement the reforms effectively, demonstrated by its experience under the first ICIP and with the policy-based programs of other development partners.The Second ICIP is estimated to cost $63 million equivalent for 2015 2018, to help support a part of the development financing needs from the perspective of the overall projected budgetary financing requirements of the country (para. 14). The development financing needs are projected at approximately $600 million (2015), $517 million (2016), and $424 million (2017). The government has requested a grant not exceeding $20 million from ADB's Special Funds resources to help finance subprogram 1. Subprogram 2 (with an estimated loan amount of $23 million) and subprogram 3 (with an estimated loan amount of $20 million) are subject to further discussion between ADB and the government.The grant for subprogram 1 will be provided in a single tranche and funds may be withdrawn upon fulfillment of the policy actions. The subsequent subprograms will be submitted for ADB Board consideration upon completion of the policy actions. The proceeds of the grant will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's simplification of disbursement procedures and related requirements for policy-based loansNote: A country's eligibility for Asian Development Fund grants under the revised grant framework is determined by its risk of debt distress. The outlook for the Kyrgyz Republic has deteriorated markedly since 2014. ADB considers that the Kyrgyz Republic is at moderate risk of debt distress for 2014, and is therefore eligible to receive 100% Asian Development Fund grant allocation.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/41544-088/main,30 Jul 2015,20000000.0,0,2015,Education,Yes

Regional,Regional,Exploring Risk-based Debt Sustainability Assessment Methods,"This small-scale research and development technical assistance (S-RDTA) will explore the application of risk-based debt sustainability methods in the Asian context. This follows up on RDTA 7662, which in 2012 led to the publication of the book titled _Debt Sustainability in Developing Asia_. There, we compiled a public debt database for ADB Developing Member Countries (DMCs) and conducted IMF-type Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) for market-access countries, complemented by stochastic analysis in the form of fan charts. Premised on a favorable macroeconomic and fiscal outlook for most countries in the region, we concluded public debt to be generally sustainable. This S-RDTA will first update the public debt database for all DMCs to reflect the latest data available. For a few select DMCs, DSA projections will be updated to incorporate the risks from the macroeconomic stochastic environment. Analysis will then seek to move beyond the conventional approach based on scenario projections and debt ratio indicators, toward a better accounting for the risks faced by the public sector. Building on recent progress in the field of balance-sheet approaches to sovereign risk analysis , this project shall explore the feasibility of combining DSA with Value at Risk (VaR) or Contingent Credit Analysis (CCA) for a broader assessment of risk factors to public debt sustainability. These analytical frameworks for assessing sustainability under uncertainty will also account for important contingent liabilities, such as the public debt implications from a systemic banking crisis.Data constraints and resource limitations will likely limit the application of risk-based DSA to one or two select DMCs, to be chosen by the project team in consideration of data availability and country characteristics. The potential for possible future extensions of the analysis to as many DMCs as possible will be assessed. As concerns macroeconomic stochastic analysis as an extension of conventional DSA, the research team will select four DMCs deemed of particular interest and suitable for analysis. Again, country focus will be decided at project inception according to data availability, the presence of debt and risk profiles of particular analytical interest, and a country's inclusion or not in previous analyses.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/49099-001/main,27 Apr 2015,220000.0,0,2015,Public sector management,Yes

India,South Asia,Enabling Monetization of Infrastructure Assets in India,"The importance given by the Government of India to infrastructure has increased substantially by doubling the target investment requirements to Rs51 trillion (more than $1.0 trillion) in the sector under the current 12th Five Year Plan (2012 2017). Supply of long term financing for infrastructure has historically been the stronghold of commercial banks. With the rapid growth in bank credit to infrastructure, banks are increasingly becoming constrained lending to the sector as they gradually are approaching their internal and prudential exposure limits. With the implementation of Basel III in March 2019 in India, banks and in particular, public sector undertaking (PSU) banks are not well placed to meet capital projections to manage the transition. PSU banks will have to rely heavily on government contributions and/or raise external capital. In this context, if banks are to continue to lend to the infrastructure sector, it will need to secure long-term viable sources of funds or sell-down existing loans to create liquidity and additional capital. The capacity and development technical assistance on Enabling Monetization of Infrastructure Assets (the Project) in India aims to (i) identify the rationale, the issues and challenges, and the enabling framework for securitization; (ii) engage with regulators and market participants; and (iii) develop a structure and roadmap that will lead to piloting a project of monetizing or securitizing infrastructure loans of select PSU banks in India.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/48353-001/main,13 Feb 2015,225000.0,0,2015,Finance,No

Viet Nam,South East Asia,Support to Border Areas Development,"The Support to Border Areas Development Project (Project) will help the five participating provinces (the Provinces) of Kon Tum, Gia Lai, Dak Lak, Dak Nong, and Binh Phuoc to better realize their growth potential and become more closely integrated into subregional frameworks including the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), the Cambodia Lao PDR Viet Nam Development Triangle Area (CLV-DTA), and the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC). It will improve the project area's connectivity by developing critical transport infrastructure, leading to increased movement of people, agricultural produce, and other goods. Moreover, it will facilitate logistics and trade, and help develop the Provinces' capacity for investment planning from a regional integration perspective. As the Provinces are at the joint borders of the Cambodia, Lao , Viet Nam Development Triangle Area (CLV-DTA) , the project will enable them to serve as an engine and gateway to wider markets for this subregional initiative. The Project is included in the ADB Viet Nam COBP for 2014-2016. A Project Preparatory Technical Assistance (PPTA) is required to develop a project suitable for ADB funding in terms of technical, financial, economic, institutional, sector policy, legal and safeguards contexts, in conjunction with the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2012-2015.The five provinces have rich natural resources, with agriculture continuing to be a major driver of economic development led by paddy, coffee, rubber and pepper, which are the major export crops. However, their poverty incidence, with exception of Binh Phuoc, is the second highest in the country, standing at 20.3% compared to 12.6% for the whole country in 2011. Ethnic Minority (EM) people account for more than 50% of the poor and in some areas of the DTA poverty rates exceed 80% . The poor households in these areas have not benefited much from national economic development trends. Provincial agricultural planning is largely undertaken on the basis of achieving specific targets, which often has excluded the EMs due to their lack of knowledge, skills and assets, as well as lack of or limited access to social services and employment. Improving the access to higher value markets in Phnom Penh, Vientiane, Ha Noi, Ho Chi Minh City and Bangkok would enable the Provinces to expand value chains and trade of their primary products and stimulate demand for their rural and agricultural production. In recent years, most of the major national roads running through localities within the project area and those linking to large seaports in Central Vietnam (Da Nang, Dung Quat and Quy Nhon) have been rehabilitated. However, road sections, particularly from rural areas and district centers, to national highways need urgent repairs and upgrading both to meet current and potential future transport volumes. Fragmentation in the transport and logistics system directly causes fragmentation particularly agricultural value chains. This leads to inefficiencies resulting in higher costs throughout the input and output chains. Moreover, the opportunity for diversification in rural production to respond to market signals is dampened, since certain higher value goods cannot effectively reach markets at competitive prices.Viet Nam actively participates in various subregional programs, most notably the GMS but also a leading member of the CLV-DTA. Concerted effort is currently made to transform the existing GMS transport corridors to economic corridors by promoting economic activities, for which Viet Nam has a key role to play. The country is also keen to prioritize development support for the CLV-DTA, which lies between the GMS East-West and Southern Economic Corridors, and therefore could pursue synergies with the GMS program. The CLV-DTA development plans are outlined in its Master Plan 2020, but progress in achieving the planned targets is modest.

Viet Nam,South East Asia,Establishing the Wholesale Electricity Market,"Energy is one of ADB's priority sectors of engagement in Viet Nam. CPS indicates that the energy sector operations will focus on reform and market development to meet electricity demand with reliable, environmentally sustainable supply. The activities of the TA, to be executed by the TA consultants, are as follows:Activity 1: Basic and advanced trainings on generic wholesale market mechanisms, Consultations with ERAV and key power sector players revealed that potential market participants lack the understanding of a wholesale electricity market. The TA consultants will organize two workshops (basic and advanced courses) to lecture on the mechanisms of a generic wholesale electricity market based on international experience. Participants to the workshop include the Power Corporations, NLDC (SMO), GENCOs, NPT, EPTC and prospective renewable energy investors, large consumers and wholesalers. This activity envisages an overseas study tour to a country in the region (limited to ADB's member countries) which has a functioning wholesale electricity market (e.g. Singapore, Australia). Participants are expected to be the from Power Corporations, NLDC (SMO) and ERAV. The TA consultants will research and summarize the characteristics and the status of wholesale markets in the potential study tour destinations, propose a destination, and make logistical arrangements. If deemed necessary, the TA consultants will accompany the study tour.Activity 2: Recommendation on new functions and critical requirements of Power Corporations and NLDC (SMO) for the VWEM. Sub-Activity 2-1: Assessment of the draft VWEM design, market rules and legal and regulatory framework. AFD is recruiting experts to prepare the detailed design of the VWEM, and other development partners are envisaged to provide support to draft the market rules and the legal and regulatory framework. The TA consultants will review the drafts in detail, and will organize (i) a workshop to widely disseminate the VWEM mechanism to the same participants to the Activity 1 workshop, and (ii) workshop(s) to provide detailed explanation on the functions and responsibilities of the Power Corporations and NLDC (SMO) under VWEM. The TA consultants will take note of the feedbacks obtained during the workshops, and present them to ERAV for their consideration.Sub-Activity 2-2: Recommendation on new functions and critical requirements of Power Corporations and NLDC (SMO). Based on the review of the VWEM design, etc. and discussions in Activity 2-1, the TA consultants will prepare, separately for the Power Corporations and NLDC (SMO), recommendations on modifications to their charter, objective (mission), business registration, legal status, functions, business model, financing, budgeting, staffing, information and communication technology (ICT) hardware and software (see Activity 3 for details), retrenchment, training requirement, etc. The recommendation will also include action plans and cost estimates to implement the recommended solutions. It is expected that the TA consultants are already familiar with the current structure of the power sector in Viet Nam. The TA consultants will organize a workshop to present the draft recommendations on the reorganization, seek feedback which should be incorporated in the final recommendations.Activity 3: Review the current ICT infrastructure of Power Corporations and NLDC (SMO), and recommendation for upgrading ICT infrastructure for the VWEM. The TA consultants will review the current ICT infrastructure of Power Corporations and NLDC (SMO), including: supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and energy management (EMS) systems, SCADA and demand management systems, metering system, software/tools for managing operation of distribution network, etc. The TA consultants will assess the adaptation of the current system with the VWEM's requirements, especially in the aspects of collecting and transferring real-time operational data, collecting and transferring metering data, controlling and operating grid's elements.

Indonesia,South East Asia,Sustainable and Inclusive Energy Program,"Access to reliable and cost-effective sources of modern forms of energy is a pre-requisite for growth and productivity improvement, and can help Indonesia avoid the pitfalls of the middle income trap. While this is particularly true for the country's manufacturing and commercial centers, it is also important that access to modern forms of energy be available to millions of Indonesians living in remote areas across the far-flung archipelago. Otherwise, the benefits of national growth will be limited to the country's economic centers and leave behind people living in less connected areas. Furthermore, this push for increased energy use needs to come at a minimal environmental cost if Indonesia is to preserve the quality of its local environment and honor its commitments to global environmental protection.Most indications are that Indonesia's energy sector is underperforming. Energy security concerns have increased in recent years. Fossil fuels currently dominate Indonesia's energy mix. While Indonesia is particularly well-endowed with a range of renewable energy resources, namely geothermal, biomass, solar, and hydropower, it lags behind its regional peers in its ability to promote the use of renewables for power generation or transportation. With domestic production of oil declining, Indonesia is increasingly dependent on imported oil to meet its burgeoning domestic demand. Similarly, in recent years, the rate of growth of gas production has stalled, and Indonesia has initiated the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG).The government has also indicated its strong interest in supporting other renewable sources of electricity. In 2013-2014, the government announced a program to support grid-connected solar PV plants through a combination of ceiling prices and tendering, and also announced a feed in tariff for waste to-energy projects, and for hydropower projects that are less than 10 MW in size. The government is currently considering alternate incentives schemes for supporting grid-connected wind energy and is also preparing an incentive scheme for biomass-based power (from agricultural waste or woody biomass).Energy access has also been brought to the forefront through a series of recent policy initiatives. MEMR has chosen Sumba Island in Nusa Tenggara Timur as an _iconic island_ where energy access would be expanded from the current baseline of about 30% using renewable energy. With the assistance of ADB5 and other development partners, the government hopes to showcase Sumba as an example of how spatial planning tools, technology approaches, financing models and implementation approaches, can be dovetailed to scale up energy access in remote parts of Indonesia, using renewable energy. This detailed work complements the ongoing regional energy planning and resource surveys being undertaken by the World Bank in association with PLN. ADB is undertaking a review of the challenges and opportunities for expanding electrification in Eastern Indonesia and this analysis will serve as the basis for convening a high-level dialogue in late 2014 of related ministries and government entities and development partners on how to plan for and obtain financing for a large-scale roll out of a rural electrification program in Eastern Indonesia.The government has taken significant steps towards lowering subsidies for electricity and moving towards a cost-reflective tariff, and putting place cash transfers and smart subsidies to protect the poor from the tariff increase. The tariff was increased by an average of 15% in 2013 with the increases being phased in on a quarterly basis (MEMR Regulation No. 30/2012). In mid-2014, the government announced a further average tariff hike of nearly 13% which will be phased in during the course of the year. There is also an ongoing effort to move away from the current public service obligation framework wherein PLN is reimbursed the difference between its actual costs of operation plus a margin (7%)",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/48323-001/main,20 Jun 2015,1000000.0,0,2015,Energy,Yes
Regional,Regional,Mapping Resilience to Fragility and Conflict in Asia and the Pacific,"The goal of this TA is to help build resilience through supporting fragility and conflict-sensitive approaches to development in selected fragile states in Asia and the Pacific. Building on previous assistance supporting ADBs engagement in FCAS, specific assessment tools have been piloted (e.g., peacebuilding tool, guide to fragility assessment, fragility index, institutional strengthening framework, customized risk management framework). This TA will support and expand their application in FCAS DMCs and will provide the means to capture collective local knowledge (resilience mapping) to better understand the operating context and the interaction between intervention and context. This will enable more effective policies and programs designed specifically to address the complex development issues in FCAS. A key lesson from earlier TAs is that further strengthening of ADB and counterpart agencies capacities for engagement in FCAS, as well as stakeholders participation, to avoid negative effects and maximise positive impacts for peacebuilding/statebuilding and development, is needed to improve development effectiveness in such fragile settings. The resilience mapping one of the recommendations of the Manila forum will: (i) capture the drivers of fragility and conflict in FCAS country, (ii) identify ways to cultivate the country's strategies, programs and projects, to nurture peacebuilding and statebuilding efforts to build resilience, and (iii) integrate all existing assessments that can be used by FCAS governments and development partners in country programming and project financing into a customized (country-specific) framework for peacebuilding and statebuilding. The mapping exercise will be based on the judicious use of all fragility and conflict assessment tools and processes, some of which have been developed and piloted under earlier ADB TA. This will include, but is not limited to, assessments of capacity, institutions, gender, civil society, economic policy, state performance and governance, natural hazards, and political economy. The mapping of resilience to fragility and conflict will be piloted in one selected FCAS country prior to replication in other fragile situations to design a customized framework. A training program on fragility and conflict-sensitive approach to development will also be conducted for concerned staff and partner government agencies to better understand how to integrate fragile/conflict-sensitivity within complex institutional cultures, structures and systems, and how to operationalize it in difficult and volatile political contexts. A communication strategy, in turn, will be prepared and implemented to promote and advocate the wider use of the resilience mapping exercise to implement fragility and conflict-sensitivity approaches to development among key international and local players in FCAS as basis for the formulation of national development plans, country programming, and project formulation.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/48397-001/main,15 Dec 2014,900000.0,0,2014,Public sector management,No

Pakistan,Central and West Asia,Federally Administered Tribal Areas Water Resources Development Project,"The scope of the proposed project will be based on the recommendations of the water assessment study carried out under FRDP, which address the issues such as water scarcity, insufficient irrigation facilities, water conservation, and weak water resource management. The study identified that groundwater aquifers in all the watersheds were depleting even under average weather conditions because of unplanned exploitation of groundwater for irrigation and domestic use, and recommended shift from groundwater to surface water. It identified potential for developing surface water resources for irrigated agriculture and other uses, and integrating that with the watershed management and command area development to ensure sustainable use of the resources without degrading the watersheds. It proposed sites for small reservoirs/ponds and diversion weirs in 44 watersheds of Mohamand, Bajaur, and Khyber Agencies to bring new land under irrigation along with improved watershed management. The Project will provide irrigation supplies in three agencies to increase crop production of the rain fed area and unutilized land to be brought under cultivation. It will (i) construct small reservoirs/ponds, diversion weirs, and conveyance channels; (ii) develop command area; and (iii) improve watershed management. The project impact will be increased farm incomes in the project area thereby reducing poverty and increasing household food security. The project outcome will be improved agricultural productivity of selected watersheds and their associated natural resource base. Project outputs include (i) construction of new irrigation infrastructure, including nine small concrete gravity dams with a maximum height of 15 meters each, 31 diversion weirs, and 95 kilometers of main and secondary irrigation channels; (ii) improved on-farm management through construction of 144 kilometers of lined watercourses, terracing and land leveling on a command area of 4,615 ha, along with installation of rain and stream gauges to measure water availability; (iii) improved watershed management on 5,050 ha through afforestation of the degraded watersheds and, where appropriate, construction of check dams; and (iv) efficient project management and evaluation.",Active,http://www.adb.org/projects/47021-002/main,07 Aug 2015,27930000.0,0,2015,"Agriculture, natural resources and rural development",Yes
Viet Nam,South East Asia,Improving Portfolio Performance and Aid Management,"a. Link to Country Partnership Strategy/Regional Cooperation Strategy: A thematic focus of the Country Partnership Strategy for Viet Nam 2012-2015 is governance and capacity development. Improved institutional arrangements and capacity for ODA management will help increase aid effectiveness which, in turn, will contribute to enhancing economic efficiency, which is one of the pillars of the CPS.The proposed TA will replicate and deepen successful activities of the ongoing TA 8034: Support to Improve Portfolio Performance and Aid Effectiveness. The proposed TA will continue the successful EA Training Calendar programs on project management under TA 8034 to meet EA training needs. While Government regulations now officially allow for advance actions, actual implementation of advance actions requires awareness raising and technical support. New Government regulations, project management experiences and lessons learnt (compiled in the Handbook on Processing and Implementing ADB Projects in Viet Nam which is being prepared under TA 8034) will be disseminated to EAs/PMU through training programs under the proposed TA. The proposed TA will address emerging issues, such as minimizing the consequences of shortage of counter-part funds and the need for more focused portfolio reviews.b. ImpactThe impact will be effective aid management by the Government of Viet Nam. The target is that total ODA disbursements to Viet Nam during 2015-2020 will reach $18 billion.c. Outcome The outcome will be improved performance of ADB's portfolio in Viet Nam. By 2017, the loan disbursement ratio will be stabilized at 20 percent or more and the project loan contract awards ratio will increase to 20 percent from 15.6 percent in 2013.d. OutputsThe TA outputs will be (i) improved capacity for project implementation and supervision; (ii) improved project implementation readiness; (iii) strengthened Government Development Partners coordination for portfolio management; and (iv) institutional reform support for effective ODA management. Output 1: Improved capacity for project implementation and supervision. Capacity building activities would result in faster compliance with ADB procedures. They will be built upon, replicate and refine the successful training programs under TA 8034. To support the immediate need for improved contract awards and disbursement performance, annual demand-driven Training Calendars, mainly class-room type training workshops tailored to different groups of participants, will be implemented. Training topics will include, but not limit to, advance actions, project planning, contract management, disbursement and audit, and introduction on portfolio performance indicators. The training programs will use training modules developed under TA 8034. New training modules will be developed to cover emerging portfolio performance areas. Priority will be given to big projects with large packages. The target participants will include not only PMU staff but also staff of EA departments who are responsible for project documents appraisal and who play an important role in accelerating the approval process in the line ministries. Most of the training workshops are home-grown and will be conducted in Vietnamese by VRM staff to facilitate better understanding and interaction. Awareness raising workshops on ADB policies/procedures and the gaps between ADB and Government systems will be conducted for relevant Government oversight bodies, including, among others, the Treasuries and the Inspectorates. Better understanding of ADB procedures by these oversight bodies will enhance PMU confidence in complying with ADB procedures. The outreach beyond PMU staff to officials of line ministries and other government agencies would lead to institutional capacity improvements in the longer-term. Output 2: Improved project implementation readiness. Extensive support will be provided to ADB-funded projects in the pipeline to prepare and implement advance actions. It will include reaching out to EA management and appraisal departments to clarify the need and feasibility of advance actions; assisting PMUs in developing advance action implementation schedules to maximize the benefit of advance actions; and reviewing bidding documents/bid evaluation reports of advance procurement packages to improve the quality of those documents before submission to ADB. Output 3: Strengthened Government Development Partners coordination for portfolio management. Portfolio performance reviews will be more effective when the ownership of the Government is ensured. The TA will support portfolio reviews including, but not limited to, support the ODA NSC, provincial governments in preparing Issues Papers for joint ADB-ODA NSC/provincial portfolio reviews and joint Government - Six Banks Joint Portfolio Performance Reviews (JPPRs). Mechanisms for tracking counter-part fund allocation and actual provision/disbursement under ADB-funded projects will be explored.Output 4: Institutional reform support for effective ODA management. ADB, individually and jointly with the Six Banks group, will continue to conduct policy dialogue on necessary changes to the legal framework and institutional arrangements. Thematic studies will be conducted to provide inputs to various Government-Development Partners fora including the Viet Nam Development Partnership Forum (VDPF), the Aid Effectiveness Forum, and JPPRs. A study on PMUs, building upon the previous PMU studies of other development partners, will be conducted to provide inputs to a planned MPI circular on PMU professionalization and a planned government-led PMU Certification Program. This would support the development of the legal framework for PMU professionalization , and enhance the sustainability of capacity building efforts and supplement Output 1. Other thematic studies will be identified during TA implementation to best respond to emerging portfolio performance issues.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/48183-001/main,27 Feb 2015,1200000.0,0,2015,Public sector management,No

India,South Asia,Support to Scheme of Fund for Regeneration of Traditional Industries,"There are several areas that need further development before the scheme can take off, as these aspects were not studied when designing the original or expanded version of SFURTI: (i) there is no previous evidence of private equity interest in traditional sectors and no market scoping of potential private partners has been undertaken;(ii) the revenue model is uncertain as there has been no marketing outreach to determine strength of cash flows of the clusters;(iii) it is uncertain why and how private sector players will be interested in acquiring a minority stake in the cluster SPVs without a compelling business case;(iv) while potential interest might exist in a few cases where major players can integrate their value chain with the products (such as agricultural commodities) developed by the cluster SPVs, this is unlikely for all products;(v) it is unclear if the scale of interventions envisaged under the scheme would be adequate to meet intended objectives;(vi) the willingness of the private sector to commit to the task of functioning as nodal agencies is unclear as there does not appear, a priori, to be a strong business case; and(vii) given competing uses of land, for e.g., it is uncertain why private parties, as nodal agencies would commit land to this initiative where returns are uncertain, as is envisaged in the scheme.Given the above uncertainties, it is necessary to understand the sector and develop a strong business case for private sector participation, as well as to analyze if the current arrangements need modification in any way. The willingness of the private sector to commit CSR funds also needs to be examined. The revenue model also needs to be understood and a market assessment is required to determine the strength of cash flows under different scenarios. In light of the above, it may also be highlighted that there is likely limited understanding and appreciation of the rural artisans in operating commercially. In addition, ADB also has limited experience in supporting schemes in the rural and traditional sectors. A case in point is the Khadi Reform and Development Program that has significant implementation challenges.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/48352-003/main,12 Dec 2014,225000.0,0,2014,Public sector management,No

Regional,Regional,Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation: Knowledge Sharing and Services in Transport and Transport Facilitation,"The Technical Assistance (TA) acts as a vehicle for generation, management and dissemination of knowledge aimed at strengthening the implementation of the CAREC Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy 2020 (TTFS2020). The focus areas of the TA are based on TTFS 2020 operational priorities, with an emphasis on those topics on which CAREC countries have limited to no experience, and where policy advisory inputs and knowledge support under the TA will add the most value. These include regional multimodal/intermodal connectivity (including regional logistics hubs and maritime links, Designated Rail Corridor services, coordinated border management, public-private partnerships, safety, asset management, user charges and cost recovery, and green freight and logistics. A key feature of the TA will be that of horizontal partnership and mutual benefit among participating countries, so a win-win situation can emerge as an outcome for all vested parties. There are several examples of successful south-south knowledge cooperation around the world, including in the CAREC context. For example, Kyrgyz Republic had provided guidance to Tajikistan in the World Trade Organization accession. More recently, the CAREC trade facilitation team at ADB is trying out twinning arrangements between countries that have acceded to the Revised Kyoto Convention and those that have not. Based on this, the TA will emphasize knowledge cooperation among CAREC countries and between CAREC countries and other regional cooperation initiatives. In doing so, the TA will provide a myriad of benefits for CAREC countries. It will facilitate learning and consensus-building on regional issues linked to effective TTFS 2020 implementation (e.g., harmonization of standards, designated rail corridor services); improve access to tested and adapted technology and tools without having to reinvent the wheel, and enable exchange of experience with countries that share similar constraints and opportunities.

The MBI objective of promoting business environment reforms in CLMV aligns to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Strategy 2020 strategic focus on PSD, as well as the GMS Economic Cooperation Program Strategic Framework 2012- 2022 in recognition of the critical role of the private sector as an engine of GMS development.MBI adopts a focused and strategic approach towards aligning national and regional PSD agendas. The MBI thinks regionally and act nationally in that it is a regional initiative focusing on common regional issues, but offering national solutions. Success of the MBI depends critically on its modality. The MBI design enables ADB to rapidly mobilize targeted expertise for analytical work, policy reform, and capacity building in response to government and private sector requests for assistance. Significant resources will be set aside to support reform implementation. The MBI relies on an understanding of political economy, and on in-built flexibility to disengage and change focus as circumstances require. Reforming the business environment takes many years and requires sustained political and policy support. A key feature of MBI is that it will be demand driven, can respond quickly to requests from CLMV, and provide ongoing support to implement the reforms and achieve tangible results. MBI aims to take novel approaches to PSD in the region; inevitably some of the initiatives that it undertakes will be experimental. Even if initiatives are based on sound analytical work and monitored closely, some unsuccessful reform efforts are inevitable because of their inherent complexity. Accordingly, the MBI has adopted an M&E framework that allows for close monitoring of projects to limit cost of stalled projects, allow for strategic exits, and provide a framework for learning for the future. MBI also engages and transfers knowledge from ASEAN economies outside of CLMV, as well as global best practices.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/48270-001/main,03 Dec 2014,1000000.0,0,2014,Public sector management,No

Tajikistan,Central and West Asia,Wholesale Metering and Transmission Reinforcement Project,"The proposed project will improve: (i) electricity wholesale metering and billing all over the Republic of Tajikistan; and (ii) electricity supply in Panjakent region through reinforcement of high voltage transmission network. The outcome of the project will be an expanded and metered transmission system. The outputs of the project include: (i) installation of 2,700 wholesale meters and billing system; and (ii) 90 km of new 220kV transmission line interconnecting the Panjakent and Ayni regions. In 2001 the government initiated a three phase (commercialization, separation, privatization) restructuring process of Barki Tojik. The first phase, commercialization, is extensively supported by ADB through Sector Operational Performance Improvement Program (SOPI). The program addresses the issues of governance, financial management, control and audit, legal and regulatory frameworks, management systems, organizational structure and technical operations. On 11 June 2013, the government approved the restructuring action plan and new structure of Barki Tojik, with three departments under the same legal entity; generation, transmission, and distribution. Heads of these departments have already been appointed and formation of new structure, based on international practices of modern power utility, is ongoing. Restructuring of Barki Tojik, requires capital investments. The government undertook steps in this direction as well. The turnkey contract for installation of supervisory control and data acquisition system (SCADA) and associated telecommunication system, financed by ADB, is expected to be awarded in the first quarter of 2014. The World Bank and EBRD are financing the installation of the retail (end-user) meters in the two biggest load centers, Dushanbe and Khujand. The remaining gap is the bulk electricity metering from generation, through transmission and up to retail meters. There is a need of installation of wholesale meters and associated billing system, which will enable the management of Barki Tojik to: (i) account all electricity flows and associated costs; (ii) quantify technical and non-technical losses at the wholesale level of the entire grid, and plan actions for their reduction; and (iii) support the restructuring through definition of clear borders between generation, transmission and distribution. At the same time, certain parts the Tajikistan transmission grid of still suffer from disconnection from the Central Asian Power System in November 2009. Prior to the disconnection, the Penjikend region of Tajikistan, with population of 261,000 (39,122 customers), was supplied from two 220 kilovolt (kV) lines from Uzbekistan. From Panjakent electricity was further transmitted to Ayni region with population of 75,000 (2,100 customers). Peak demands of Panjakent and Ayni are 75 MW and 20 MW, respectively. From Panjakent to Ayni electricity was transmitted over 102 kilometers through 110 kV line built in 1965 and with maximum rating of 67 MW. After 2009, these two regions became isolated from the main transmission grid of Tajikistan. Barki Tojik addressed the issue and in 2011 energized new 'Sugd-Ayni 220 kV line which interconnected Ayni with main transmission grid. From Ayni electricity is currently supplied further to Panjakent using old 110 kV line. However, since the demand in Panjakent is higher than the capacity of the line, households and industry in the region suffer from load shedding even in summer time, which is energy surplus period in Tajikistan. Additional transmission capacity is, urgently needed to satisfy current and future power demand, which is expected to grow to 100 MW in next 3-5 years primarily caused by industrial development.",Active,http://www.adb.org/projects/47017-003/main,24 Apr 2015,51820000.0,0,2015,Energy,No

A comprehensive approach was required to rebuild the financial system in a devastated economy that had no finance sector. Responding to the government's needs, the approach has been broadly based so far. After successfully rebuilding the basic foundation of the banking industry under the first and second programs, the third program has begun to support the sector's expansion to cover the important subsectors of nonbanking services and capital markets, and to boost investors' and beneficiaries' confidence in the system with a stronger legal and regulatory framework, necessary infrastructure, and better quality of services, including consumer protection.The third program has focused on creating an enabling environment for all sector stakeholders, including the various regulators. The scope has shifted from the establishment of regulatory frameworks to their effective implementation and oversight, and more transparency. Proper financial infrastructure is required to meet rising market needs for more efficient and diverse financial services, as is further development of the legal foundations to ensure smooth transactions in the sector. These reforms require coordination within the government and careful sequencing, including dialogue with the private sector. The third program has been facilitating closer coordination.After completion of the third program, ADB will continue the policy dialogue with the government under the Post-Program Partnership Framework. Also, ADB's technical assistance (TA) for implementing subprogram 2 of the Third Financial Sector Program has been extended to June 2015 to deal with the remaining issues.6 However, for the next round of support, ADB should concentrate on its areas of comparative advantage, in consultation with other development partners and the government.

People's Republic of China,East Asia,Study on Local Financial Market Development and Supervisory Framework,"The current financial regulatory structure in PRC is sector based; as the central bank, Peoples' Bank of China (PBOC) is responsible for monetary policy and the stability of the financial system in general, while the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC), China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), and China Insurance Regulatory Commission are central authorities responsible for regulating banking, securities, and insurance sectors.

As a result, the provincial government was empowered with supervising authority for microcredit companies, new rural financial institutions, and financing guarantee companies based on CBRC's regulations. In 2012, the State Council and CSRC vested supervising authority to provincial government for overseeing regional OTC market.

Indonesia,South East Asia,Strengthening the Local Government Bond Market,"Lack of infrastructure. ADB has identified lack of infrastructure as a binding constraint in the development of Indonesian's economy. The government also shared the same views and estimated investment needs for infrastructure within 2010-2014 to be roughly US$ 214 billion. Limited fiscal space, however, led the government to look for more private participation in infrastructure projects. The Economic Master Plan for Acceleration and Expansion of Indonesia Economic Development, 2011-2015 (MP3EI) identifies national infrastructure projects that can accelerate and expand Indonesia's economy. The implementation of MP3EI requires commitment from the central and also the sub-national governments (SNGs). Under Indonesia's decentralized governance structure, the provision of infrastructure has increasingly become the responsibility of SNGs bodies, which defined by Law 32 on regional governments to be provincial, district, and municipal levels. Despite this, most funding is still derived from national government transfers, with little mobilization at the sub-national levels. This TA aims to assist in building the capacity of selected SNGs to mobilize funding for infrastructure development through the issuance of bonds and also to improve local government's capacity to prioritize their investment needs.Decentralization gives more responsibilities to SNGs. Indonesia's long-term decentralization policy objectives are to improve the delivery of basic services and infrastructure to local communities across the country. Since implementation of _big bang_ decentralization reforms in 2001, about 33% of total public expenditure, up from barely 7% in 2000, have been delegated to SNGs. The reforms launched in 2001 involved a massive delegation of responsibility for the provision of public services and the reassignment of two-thirds of central government civil servants and more than 16,000 service delivery facilities to SNGs. Now, SNGs are responsible in managing their own fiscal and development affairs. The management quality of their public investment, including the infrastructure sectors, corresponds to the quality of basic service delivery given to their constituent. The result on the ground, however, has been disappointing. While many SNGs run fiscal budget surpluses, when capital investment needs are taken into account, they have insufficient financial resources to meet their investment needs, which far exceed their revenues and surpluses. In effect, public service delivery at local level has been disappointing and negatively impacts local business environment. With low quality of infrastructure, local business activities have not reached their optimal level. On this background, there is a need for more private participation in mobilizing large-scale infrastructure funding. Municipal bonds are seen as one way to encourage more private participation.Local service delivery is mostly financed with central government grants. Currently, the largest unconditional grant available to SNGs (the General Allocation Fund [DAU]) accounts, on average, for 50% of total SNGs' revenues. The SNGs' share of revenues from extractive industries (the dana bagi hasil [revenue sharing]) represents 17% of their revenues; an additional 7% is accounted for by the infrastructure development grant (the Specific Allocation Fund [DAK]). Total grants to SNGs have more than doubled since 2005, from an estimated Rp150 trillion to around Rp350 trillion in 2010. Local revenue, from limited taxes and charges, represented about 16% of total SNGs' revenue. In addition to these revenues, more and more SNGs are borrowing money from the central government to finance their capital projects.Local financing relies mostly on central government loans that are given through either Subsidiary Loan Agreements (SLAs) or the Regional Development Account (RDA). The loans made through these mechanisms, particularly the SLA, were often driven by central ministries managing donor-financed projects that were conceived and designed to respond to concerns articulated at the central, rather than the local level. The commitment of SNGs and enterprises to repay their loans was never tested ex-ante in these arrangements, and ex-post problems arose. In addition, the RDA and SLA were managed primarily as central government programs. The SNGs view the ownership of projects funded through RDA and SLA is with the central government. Options needed to increase public capital investment. To increase capital investment over time, SNGs will need to have access to various sources of funding beyond the intergovernmental transfers and SNG's own source revenues. Therefore, it is necessary for the central government to develop an appropriate SNG borrowing and debt management framework, in particular to facilitate creation of sub-national capital market and encourage active participation of SNGs into the market.Municipal bonds as options to increase local financing for infrastructure projects. The central government has allowed SNGs to issue local bonds since 2007. The aim is for SNG to finance their public investment which has multiplier effect and not to finance local operating budget deficit. The regulation is based on international best practices that emphasize fiscal capacity. Criteria that are based on institutional requirements and financial viability ensure no weak and debt-ridden SNGs can issue a municipal bond. The two institutional requirements are the SNG need to obtain unqualified or qualified opinion from the _Supreme Audit Board_ and there needs to be a functioning _debt management unit_ within their PFM organization. The two financial criteria are: the SNGs' aggregate debt-service coverage ratio (DSCR) is no more than 2.5 and the accumulated debt of the SNG is no more than 75% of last year revenue. These criteria were in place to avoid SNGs overextending themselves--overburdening themselves with debt and projects--in the environment where their financial management quality is generally weak. Problems in municipal bonds' issuance. A single municipal bond has not been issued to date, due to two main issues: credit worthiness of the SNGs and the widespread lack of capacity of SNGs financial officers. The proposed TA aims to assist potential SNG to issue municipal bond by assisting them in building up their credit worthiness. First, the TA will assess the capacity of the SNG in managing their finance. There is already available diagnostic tool that can assess. For example, Standard and Poor uses their Financial Management Assessment tool to assess the financial viability's of SNGs. In the case of Indonesia, Pefindo, a local credit rating company, has used S&P FMA to assess the financial management of three municipalities, i.e. Jakarta, Balikpapan, and Makassar. The findings show that a general lack of capacity of local PFM officers is the biggest impediment. Of course, the specific PFM related competency for each city can vary. Second, the TA will build the capacity of SNG in PFM and debt management skills. Lack of PFM and debt management skills at the local level has contributed to private lenders' reluctance to make unsecured lending to the SNGs. This weakens the credit culture among SNGs. Defaults on loans by SNGs appear to be due to more an unwillingness to repay rather than the inability to repay. This is evident from the large number of local water supply utility companies (PDAM) in arrears yet SNGs continue to accumulate cash reserves. It appears that SNGs tend to view debts owed to the central government as _grants_ rather than loans. Third, the TA will build the capacity of project selection in SNGs. Given that municipal bonds in Indonesia needs to be linked to a project, it is thus pertinent for SNGs be able to select good and viable projects to be funded by the bond. Good projects will also provide strong signal on the bond itself, and thu",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/48169-001/main,18 Feb 2015,420000.0,0,2015,Finance,No

People's Republic of China,East Asia,Hubei Huanggang Urban Environment Improvement Project,"The project aims to promote environmentally sustainable and socially inclusive urbanization in Huanggang, Hubei Province by improving the urban environment. The project will improve the lakes and rivers' water quality, flood-retention capacity, and aesthetic value contributing to economic prosperity and enhanced livability in the lakeside urban areaemployment opportunities.Huanggang is located on the north bank of the middle reach of the Yangtze River in eastern Hubei Province, 78 kilometers (km) from the provincial capital, Wuhan. Building on a rural-based economy, Huanggang is one of the poorest municipalities in the province and has a relatively low urbanization rate of 35.7%. The Huanggang municipal government (HMG) in its Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 20112015 targets to transform its economic structure and facilitate urbanization with expanded secondary and tertiary industries. Huanggang is well positioned to take advantage of national and regional development plans due to its proximity to Wuhan; good connectivity with neighboring cities and provinces; and rich historic, cultural, and human resources. Huanggang has the potential to play a strategic role in facilitating socioeconomic development in the central region of the PRC. This is envisaged under the national plan. Furthermore, Huanggang is part of the Wuhan 1+8 megacity cluster, which the PRC government endorsed as a pilot for balanced regional development in the province.Huanggang is on a floodplain, with many lakes and rivers. Protecting the water environment and controlling water pollution in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the largest of the seven river basins in the PRC and also the source of a high amount of wastewater, is a key government strategy. One of the urban development constraints of Huanggang is the deteriorating water quality in lakes and rivers, which are silted and blocked with polluted sediments, hindering natural hydraulic circulation, further degrading the water environment and ecology, weakening resilience to floods and droughts, and adversely affecting public health and safety. Huanggang's three major urban lakesBaitan, Chiye, and Yiaiare severely polluted with organic matter and nutrients. Much of the surface water quality is currently measured as class V or worse. Realizing the importance of improving water quality for the city's sustainable development, HMG has made plans and increased investments to control pollution at the source and to improve the environment. To date, HMG investment has focused on improving water quality in Yiai Lake in the existing urban area, leaving other lakes and rivers unattended.Limited urban space also constrains the development potential of Huanggang. The existing central urban area in Huangzhou District is dense and inadequate for increasing economic activities. Limited urban space and inadequate urban infrastructure has slowed economic development and delayed the urbanization process, resulting in Huanggang becoming sidelined from mainstream developments in the province. To address this constraint, the approved Huanggang Municipal Urban Master Plan, 20122030 provides for eastward urban expansion by developing the New Eastern District (NED) with adequate urban space, infrastructure, and services; and an environment-friendly and socioeconomically inclusive setting to support sustainable urban development and ruralurban transition.Baitan and Chiye lakes and seven associated rivers are in the center of NED, where HMG's pollution control interventions have not yet reached. Nutrient-laden sediments from agricultural and fish farming have reached levels that affect the lakes' water quality and hydraulic retention capacity. The seven rivers are blocked due to sediments from erosion of unlined banks reducing their drainage capacity. The increased urban development will create more impervious surfaces, resulting in an increase in surface water runoff. HMG is currently improving point source pollution control in NED. The project will complement these interventions, focusing primarily on nonpoint source pollution control. It will adopt an integrated approach to water quality and retention capacity enhancements of the lakes and associated rivers by removing contaminated sediments, constructing wetlands, stabilizing lakes and rivers embankments, and improving hydraulic recirculation. As a result, water quality of Baitan and Chiye lakes will improve from class V to class IV, flood protection will increase, and the lakeside aesthetic and amenity value and health benefit will significantly rise.As part of the project's capacity development component, a water quality monitoring and forecasting system for the upstream Xingfu River catchment and Baitan and Chiye lakes will be developed and used by the Huanggang environment protection authorities for systematic and continuing water quality management. The system, which will be based on the hydraulic and water quality model developed during project preparation, has great replication potential. It can be disseminated as a good practice in sustainable pollution control and ecological preservation applicable to polluted and blocked urban lakes in small and medium-sized cities along the Yangtze River, and elsewhere in the PRC",Active,http://www.adb.org/projects/46050-002/main,06 May 2015,96280000.0,0,2015,"Agriculture, natural resources and rural development",Yes

Sri Lanka,South Asia,Green Power Development and Energy Efficiency Improvement Investment Program - Tranche 1,"In recent years Sri Lanka,has improved its energy sector and achieved a national electrification ratio of 94% (2012) as compared with 29% in 1990. However, a longer-term challenge is to reduce its high dependence on expensive fossil fuel energy. The energy sector struggles to (a) meet growing demand for electricity at a low cost and acceptable reliability rates, and (b) attain long term sustainability. The share of thermal oil-fired energy in the power generation mix has increased from 6% in 1995 to 59% in 2012 that creates a high energy cost base. Demand growth has been mostly met by expensive oil-fired thermal plants. This is not a viable and sustainable solution to the country s energy security and environment protection in the long term. Diversification of the generation mix primarily to renewable energy sources, improved network efficiency, reduced technical losses and supply and demand side management is the only way to correct this situation. The transmission network needs expansion and modernization, particularly in the former conflict-affected areas in Northern and Eastern provinces. The 33 kilovolt (kV) medium voltage (MV) network needs to expand power supply into rural areas where many households have poor reliability and inadequate quality of electricity supply.

Regional,Regional,Sustainable Environmental Management of Projects in Central and West Asia,"The impact of the TA will be sustained environmental compliance across all ADB-financed projects in participating DMCs across CWA region. The outcome will be improved implementation of SSEMPs for category A and B projects in participating DMCs across the CWA region. The TA will have three outputs: (i) project environmental monitoring solution (PEMS) developed; (ii) environmental management capacity of executing agencies enhanced; and (iii) executing agency performance on environmental management showcased.Output 1 will be delivered through development and implementation of a continuous PEMS. The PEMS will serve as a monitoring, feedback, and training loop that will result in a solution customized to meet the needs and specific capacity gaps of each executing agency. The international environmental safeguards consultant will conduct a sector-focused capacity gap analysis. The international environmental safeguards consultant will develop a five-point ranking system on safeguards compliance, which will provide detailed criteria for ranking environmental compliance of ongoing projects. This ranking system will be used to accurately measure biannually the level and quality of environmental compliance in each ongoing project. After consultations with the directors and environment specialists of the executing agencies' project management units, and ADB's project team leaders in the sector divisions, a framework for the PEMS will be developed by incorporating any concerns over implementation issues. The PEMS framework will be finalized and then implemented in the field by national environmental safeguards consultants placed at ADB's resident mission in each participating DMC.Output 2 will be achieved by developing and implementing the capacity enhancement plan. The quality of environmental management and compliance in ongoing projects is expected to increase with the implementation of the PEMS framework. The national environmental safeguards consultant placed at each resident mission will closely interact with each executing agency's project management unit, identifying executing agency- or sector-specific issues and customizing the PEMS for each executing agency. The national environmental safeguards consultant will achieve this through continuous involvement and close cooperation with all executing agencies and ADB project team leaders, and by conducting regular site visits. The national environmental safeguards consultant will first assess the capacity gaps and then develop and operationalize targeted and sustainable executing agency-specific capacity enhancement plans. Additional gaps found by the national environmental safeguards consultant will be bridged through the continuous monitoring, feedback, and training loop. Each national environmental safeguards consultant will have the annual target of improving the compliance of their projects by one ranking point, thereby ensuring improvement in environmental management at the executing agencies.Output 3 will showcase the improvement in environmental management performance by the executing agencies. The national environmental safeguards consultant at the resident mission will liaise with government environmental institutions and agencies and nongovernment agencies in each participating DMC to establish a national environment network. This national environment network will promote better understanding of the implementation of environmental safeguards in the field, and will assist in developing mechanisms to overcome the challenges at various stages of implementation. The national environmental safeguards consultant will also prepare knowledge products to showcase the successes of executing agencies and their improved ranking in environmental management; these will be instrumental in improving environmental management capacity across all executing agencies in the participating DMCs.Frequently conducted, project-focused environmental management and risk assessment training for each executing agency across the participating DMCs will increase national self-reliance in these areas. The TA through its continuous monitoring, feedback and training loop will address the prevailing situation of frequent turnover of executing agency environment staff by training all new staff. As a result, the TA will train a greater number of environmental professionals, thus moving toward sustainable environmental management. 1The key assumption to the success of the TA is that the executing agency environmental staff trained through the PEMS will be retained. In the event that staff turnover does occur, the nature of the capacity enhancement program is such that training will be repeated regularly, and will resemble the model of continuous on-the-job training to counter the impacts of staff turnover. The risk that the TA faces is that the prolonged decision-making process of executing agencies may cause delays in endorsing the ranking criteria, which could lead to long delays in actually implementing the PEMS. This risk will be managed by the active involvement and follow-up of the international environment consultant in keeping the process directed and well-paced.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/48109-001/main,10 Jun 2014,2750000.0,0,2014,"Agriculture, natural resources and rural development",Yes

Regional,Regional,"Statistical Business Registers for Improved Information on Small, Medium-Sized, and Large Enterprises","Statistical business register (SBR) is a register of enterprises or establishments involved in a business activity that is maintained by the National Statistical Office (NSO) or other parts of National Statistical System (NSS). SBR is closely linked to business registry/ies. Business registries facilitate registration of businesses as per regulatory requirements of the country and may be residing in different geographical locations, ministries or regulatory authorities. SBR on the other hand is usually centralized in the NSO and draws on the information from these registers, assembled into a directory of businesses which is then used to draw sample and population data for conducting surveys and censuses to produce official statistics. SBR hence is of fundamental importance to the NSO for the compilation of official statistics in accordance with international standards and frameworks such as the System of National Accounts 2008. Aside from being used for the conduct of surveys, SBR is also used in reconciling and/or incorporating survey results with data from administrative sources such as that obtained from tax authorities and thus providing an improved basis for production of official statistics, which are vital inputs in policy/strategy formulation such as the of country partnership strategies and for monitoring MDGs.Many Developing Member Countries (DMCs) in Asia and the Pacific, with ADB support, are currently in the process of modernizing, strengthening and improving their business registries to improve the overall business environment and facilitate private sector development . Given the close link between the business registries and the SBRs, and the strong demand in the region for assistance in this area , there is an opportunity and a need to support DMCs in establishing and improving their SBRs. This technical assistance (TA) will build on and complement the ongoing initiatives by ADB's regional departments by strengthening the link between SBRs and business registers, ensuring that the information collected via business registries is optimized by the NSSs, and contributes towards improved coordination among relevant national agencies in the collection and compilation of data on small, medium (SME) and large enterprises. These efforts would aid in improving and expanding the statistical information on SMEs and large enterprises and reducing both costs and response burden.

Regional,Regional,Improving Safeguard Policy Applications in South Asia Developing Member Countries,"Development results and effectiveness are quite often interrupted or delayed due to unsatisfactory or flawed implementation of safeguard mitigation measures. Often time implementation results are intertwined with planning and design of safeguard measures. There have been concerns over the quality of safeguard planning documents and ADB staff skills in managing implementation issues. The need to understand these implementation issues have been prioritized by SARD and therefore SARD is currently supporting a S-CDTA to assess the status of institutional capacity for implementation of environmental and social safeguards in ADB-funded infrastructure projects in India, Nepal, and Bhutan. The S-CDTA has identified a set of issues that are interrelated between environmental and social safeguard planning and implementation phases and has recommended an action plan which highlights on various level of capacity development needs in each of the 3 selected DMCs and SARD. The aim of the proposed R-CDTA is to deliver on this action plan and extend similar investigation on current status and safeguard capacity development for rest of the SARD DMCs.The regional aspect of the proposed R-CDTA will allow to avail the opportunities for South-South co-operation and sharing of best practices across SARD DMCs. It is in line with the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement 2009 that emphasizes the need for effective implementation of the safeguard measures together with the borrower. The R-CDTA also reflects the strategy encouraged by the Regional Cooperation Strategy for South Asia 2011-2015, where it supports (i) project implementation, and (ii) capacity development initiatives. As a first time for SARD, the S-CDTA has engaged SARD's clients in a dialogue on rationalizing safeguards implementation practices and the R-CDTA will deliver the improvement.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/46282-001/main,13 Dec 2013,5000000.0,0,2013,Energy,No

Philippines,South East Asia,Capacity Development to Support Regulation and Oversight at the Insurance Commission,"Until recently, the insurance sector in the Philippines has been governed by the outdated Insurance Code (1974), which has restricted the Insurance Commission 's ability to enforce the law and regulations, due to weak legal protection of supervisors and staff, hampered its ability to hire professionally qualified staff as a result of the salary standardization law, and thereby constrained the reorganization and upgrading of its management structure and supporting business processes. During the Aquino administration, the newly designated Insurance Commissioner, a professional actuary and former life insurance executive, has initiated the amendment to the Insurance Code and taken several major steps to achieve effective supervision by reorganizing the Insurance Commission from a functional setup with no information flow between units, to an organizational structure led by four deputy commissioners, with defined responsibility in the area of technical services, financial examination, management support services as well as legal and regulatory supervision. As of February 2013, the Philippine Senate and House of Representatives passed the consolidated Bill amending the Insurance Code and submitted for its approval by the President. The amendments and additional provisions in the Insurance Code, include the following: (i) minimum capital / solvency requirements for insurance companies increased from P250 million by end-2012 to P1 billion by year-end 2020; (ii) the Insurance Commissioner, now appointed by Presidential Order, for a fixed term of six years, has authority over disputes of up to P5 million; (iii) license issued to insurance companies is extended to three years ; (iii) expanded the range of investment instruments / assets admitted in the computation of equity ; (v) new provisions on microinsurance, bancassurance (together with Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas), and financial reporting framework. The Insurance Commission is preparing rules and regulations concerning the following: (i) new solvency requirement for life and non-life companies; (ii) premium deposit fund (deposit of payments); (iii) self-regulatory organization; (iv) trust business of insurance companies; (v) alternative dispute resolution (ADR) methods; (vi) increased fees, charges and fines; (viii) electronic policy forms and processes.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/47207-001/main,13 Dec 2013,225000.0,0,2013,Finance,No

Pakistan,Central and West Asia,Punjab Basmati Rice Value Chain,"This technical assistance (TA) is the outcome of wide-ranging stakeholder consultation with the Government of Pakistan and Punjab government agencies, public and private agriculture research institutions, basmati rice farmers, traders, exporters, private associations, and the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI).Basmati rice famous for its aroma, long grain, better cooking and eating quality is a leading foreign exchange earners of Pakistan, which captures more than two-thirds of the world's basmati production. In 2012, Pakistan earned about $1 billion from basmati exports of 1.5 million tons. Basmati is grown mainly in Pakistan's Punjab province. In fiscal year (FY) 2012, 65% of Punjab's total rice area, or 1.1 million hectare, was devoted to basmati with a production of about 2 million tons.The country's competitive edge in the basmati world market, however, has been eroding in the recent years because of productivity and quality constraints. Historically, Pakistan has been the world's leading and major supplier of basmati rice. During the period July December 2012, basmati exports declined by 31% (from 349,970 tons to 239,765 tons) compared to the same period in the previous years. This came after India lifted a ban on its rice exports in 2012 and sold the commodity at a price lower than Pakistan's about $100 cheaper per ton against Pakistan's $1,100-1,150 per ton. Meanwhile, demand for basmati has been increasing worldwide. Pakistan's basmati value chain needs to be strengthened to meet rising international demand and maintain its premier lead status.The major bottleneck in Pakistan's basmati value chain is at the upstream segment, or farm production. High production costs and declining yield of current basmati varieties are making its cultivation a less profitable venture to Punjab rice farmers, resulting in some farmers shifting to non-basmati varieties for better yields.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/47166-001/main,06 Mar 2014,1000000.0,0,2014,"Agriculture, natural resources and rural development",Yes

People's Republic of China,East Asia,Establishing a Regional Knowledge Hub on Green Growth and Eco-Compensation,"ADB and the PRC have been actively exploring knowledge partnerships to expand mutual learning with other developing member countries in urban development, water security, and transport sector. In March 2010, the Urban Knowledge Hub was established with the Tongji University in Shanghai, PRC to share best practices in urban planning. A knowledge partnership, covering the water sector, with the Asia-Pacific Center for Water Security was established in 2011 jointly with Tsinghua and Peking universities; while the establishment of the Transport Knowledge Hub is currently under way. The Regional Knowledge Sharing Initiative, which was jointly established by ADB and the Ministry of Finance (MOF), was launched in August 2012 and serves as a vehicle to share development experiences between the PRC and other countries. The initiative to establish a regional knowledge hub on green growth and eco-compensation results from a series of consultations during the development and preparation of various knowledge products and knowledge sharing events. Since 2009, ADB's knowledge agenda has played a major role of creating and disseminating good practices and policy thinking on the topic of eco-compensation. ADB has produced three knowledge products on eco-compensation, including: (i) An Eco-compensation Policy Framework for the People's Republic of China: Challenges and Opportunities; (ii) Payments for Ecological Services and Eco-compensation: Practices and Innovations in the People's Republic of China; and (iii) Eco-compensation for Watershed Services in the PRC. To disseminate these knowledge products, three international conferences in the PRC (held at Shizuishan, Ningxia in 2009, at Ya'an, Sichuan in 2010, and at Jiujiang, Jiangxi in 2011, respectively) on eco-compensation for knowledge sharing had been conducted and participated in by representatives from other DMCs and development partners. These conferences served as a platform for the participating DMCs to operationalize the concepts of eco-compensation and to discuss the problems encountered and how these experiences can be incorporated into the design of future projects. In addition, ADB is investing in a pilot program to operationalize some eco-compensation concepts through projects such as: Loan 2573-PRC: Guiyang Integrated Water Resources Management Project, Loan 2838-PRC: Jiangsu Yancheng Wetlands Protection Project, and Loan 2941-PRC: Anhui Chao Lake Environmental Rehabilitation Project. During the PRC country programming mission in December 2012, MOF, NDRC, and ADB agreed that it is important to jointly establish a knowledge hub on green growth and eco-compensation, promoting mutual learning and providing a unique opportunity to share knowledge, practices, and innovations on eco-compensation across the PRC and with ADB's DMCs. As a result of these discussions, a TA to support the establishment of a knowledge hub was included in the 2013 TA pipeline Near-term activities of the knowledge hub are expected to include the following: (i) develop the knowledge hub's charter, institutional framework, and operational plan and identify stakeholders and target audience, and prepare a communication and marketing plan; (ii) establish a website for green development and eco-compensation both in English and Chinese; (iii) establish a database comprising of international and domestic practices and case studies on green growth and eco-compensation; (iv) publish annual progress reports on green growth and eco-compensation both in Chinese and English; and (v) organize an annual knowledge sharing conference on green growth and eco-compensation.Establishing a knowledge hub on eco-compensation is consistent with ADB's Water Operational Plan (2011) as eco-compensation can help to create the economic incentives for effective implementation of integrated water resources management in river basins. It is also in line with ADB's PRC country partnership strategy, 2011 2015 which supports the government's goal of building a harmonious society by promoting environmentally sustainable development.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/47074-001/main,08 Jan 2014,140000.0,0,2014,"Agriculture, natural resources and rural development",Yes

Regional,Regional,Improving Procurement in South Asia,"Experience from ADB-financed projects across DMCs shows that procurement takes a considerable amount of time and is often a source of delay in project implementation. Common causes of procurement delays are weak implementation capacity, especially in procurement and project management, unfamiliarity with ADB procurement processes and procedures, weak governance system and insufficient monitoring and progress reporting in procurement. Although reform initiatives supporting procurement reforms have been implemented in several DMCs, a huge task remains to translate these into actual changes in procurement practices, improvements to procurement outcomes and better project implementation. Good organizational practice includes setting specific targets on the performance of the agency's procurement portfolio and continuously monitoring and reporting on the progress and results being achieved. This strategic approach to managing procurement is difficult to adopt without capacity and support and without the right capabilities of and incentives for procurement staff. ADB carries out procurement capacity assessments of procuring entities during project processing to detect risk areas and adopt suitable risk mitigation measures during project implementation. The underlying causes of weak procurement and implementation capacity, whether they are inherent in the executing (EA) or implementing (IA) agency or in the environment where the agencies operate, are not necessarily dealt with during project processing and project implementation stages. This contributes to significant delays during implementation of the project portfolio.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/47340-001/main,12 Dec 2013,5000000.0,0,2013,"Agriculture, natural resources and rural development",No

Regional,Regional,Strategies to Support Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises in the People's Republic of China and Mongolia,"The goal of the TA is to improve empirically-based policies that underpin the dynamism of SMEs. Specifically the TA will address the following development issues: a. Private sector development. SMEs constitute the majority of enterprises in the PRC and Mongolia. They are also important sources of employment. In Mongolia, SMEs account for approximately 50% of employment. In the PRC, they also contribute the majority (75%) of employment in the private sector. Thus SMEs play an important role in generating employment and their well-being affects the dynamism of the whole economy. Yet the business environments in both countries are still not fully conducive for SMEs. This TA would also examine constraints on SME growth, either externally imposed or seemingly self-chosen.b. Inclusive financing. Today, SMEs in Asia still have much less access to finance. The gap of SME financing in East Asia, of which the PRC constitutes a significant share, is estimated to range from $700 to $850 billion. The PRC government has adopted a range of measures to address these challenges for SMEs, especially towards increasing their access to finance. However, so far small PRC firms still access credit less frequently than the larger firms, and also at much higher costs. In Mongolia, SMEs access to credit is relatively better, but they face high interest rates and much higher collateral requirements than in other regions. More disconcertingly, evidence suggests that financial constraints lead to lower levels of investments by SMEs than larger firms, especially in the PRC. This entails significant repercussions, since the health and dynamism of the private sector depend on precisely these private investments. c. Structural transformation and productivity. Structural transformation of the economy has led to the emergence of the tertiary (services) sector as the main contributor of employment in the PRC (36%) and Mongolia (55%) by 2012. Services also created the bulk of value-added in both countries. Supporting the growth of the services sector has the added benefit of greener growth, as services are typically less energy-intensive as manufacturing. Yet compared to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, the productivity of the services sector is still low in PRC (approximately 10% of OECD levels) and Mongolia (less than 5% of OECD levels). Efforts to improve overall productivity in both countries would necessarily require efficiency and productivity improvements in the services sector, where SMEs can play a critical role.d. Gender equity. Participation of women in the ownership and of small firms in the PRC (64%) and Mongolia (65%) is higher than average. Thus, enhancing the growth of SMEs would also contribute significantly to gender inclusiveness of growth. Policies to support this goal would benefit from better data on the skills needs and gaps of the SMEs, especially in the services sector.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/47339-001/main,10 Dec 2013,225000.0,0,2013,Industry and trade,No

Improvements in the public sector accounting standards would be instrumental for DMCs to achieve good governance. This is consistent with the ADB Strategy 2020 and its development agenda on good governance, anticorruption and an enhanced government financial management system.Following the successful completion of the first four phases of the RETA, the proposed TA will be used to support IPSASB's work program for 2013 to 2015, with high priorities assigned to the new and ongoing critical public sector projects of the standard-setting activities. The draw downs are proposed in three equal tranches over the TA period. a. Link to Country Partnership Strategy/Regional Cooperation Strategy: Due to the special nature of the TA, there is no direct link to the Regional Cooperation Strategy.b. ImpactExpected impact of this TA is to improve public financial reporting and management in ADB DMCs as they adopt or make significant progress in adopting IPSAS.c. Outcome Expected outcome is significant progress on issuing a comprehensive set of IPSAS available for adoption by public sector entities in the DMCs. This will lead to the development of high quality public accounting standards that will strengthen transparency of government financial reporting.d. OutputsIssuance of finalized IPSAS, Exposure Drafts and Consultation Papers for discussion, especially those that are considered critical projects. Progress in the development of public sector conceptual framework and issuances of guidance and other resources to aid the implementation of IPSAS.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/47161-001/main,18 Feb 2014,300000.0,0,2014,Public sector management,No

Regional,Regional,Mainstreaming Integrated Solid Waste Management in Asia,"Strategy 2020 identifies infrastructure and environment as two of the five core areas of operations and private sector development and private sector operations as one of five drivers of change. Solid Waste Management (SWM), one of the most neglected areas of municipal infrastructure in Asia is a pressing need of most of DMCs to help attain environmental sustainability and enhanced quality of life for its citizens. The TA with its crosscutting infrastructure and environment focus fits well with ADB's policy. The TA also links well with Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) of several DMCs that have identified sanitation and waste management as a key area of assistance for their urban renewal. ADB's participation in SWM in DMCs though have been opportunity based. In past 10 years ADB has participated only in about 10 projects in the SWM sector and total annual waste handling through ADB financed projects has been less than 10000 tons per day. This quantity of waste is less than the solid waste generation in a single large city in Asia. It is thus evident that ADB needs increase its effort to help DMCs develop holistic citywide SWM strategy and translate those into technically feasible and commercially viable projects. This TA is a major step in this direction.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/46248-001/main,09 Dec 2013,800000.0,0,2013,Water and other urban infrastructure and services,Yes

Regional,Regional,Promoting Ecosystem Services and Forest Carbon Financing in Asia and the Pacific,"The TA will support knowledge, partnerships and assessments of ecosystem service values and their application to strategic planning and projects in participating ADB developing member countries (DMC). It will do this through the provision of technical advisory services and knowledge support to ongoing and planned ADB and DMC projects focused on integrated landscape management and coastal and marine resource management. The TA will support the achievement of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Strategic Plan for Biodiversity and Aichi Targets for 2010-2020, which targets, among others, that by 2020, biodiversity values will be integrated into national and local development and poverty reduction strategies and planning processes (Target 2). The TA is consistent with ADB's Climate Change Program (CCP), including objectives relating to managing land use and forests for carbon sequestration; and promoting climate resilient development. In particular, the TA is designed to address specific criteria of ADB's Climate Change Fund (CCF), including support to maintain, restore and enhance carbon-rich natural ecosystems, while maximize co-benefits for the conservation of biodiversity and the generation of other ecosystem services. The TA also supports the implementation of ADB's Environment Operations Directions (EOD) for 2013-2020, which highlights the importance of addressing the degradation of natural capital' and promotes the assessments of ecosystem service values as a tool. The TA will build on RDTA 41246-01: Capturing Economic Benefits from Ecosystem Services, which focused on DMC access to emerging carbon markets through REDD-plus. This included review and information sharing on DMC policies, strategies, and experiences, as well as the identification of opportunities for _co-benefits_ for biodiversity and rural livelihoods. The TA will be implemented over 24 months. Impact: Improved regional trends in reducing land and forest degradation and in sustainable coastal and marine resource management by 2020. Outcome: Increased DMC capacity to apply and integrate ecosystem service valuation in policies, strategies and/or plans by 2016. This will be measured by a review of the level of integration of ecosystem services values within selected policy and planning processes targeted by the TA. Outputs(i) Strengthened knowledge and regional partnerships for economic valuation of ecosystem services. The project will undertake a review existing methods and tools for the assessment and economic valuation of ecosystem services and biodiversity, including climate regulation services; and will review case studies to assess gaps, barriers, constraints and opportunities for wider-scale use in the region. This will be combined with a review of experiences and good practices in establishing functioning PES, REDD-plus and other sustainable business models, incentives and financial mechanisms, based on past projects and initiatives of ADB and others. Methodological issues will include consideration of classifications, concepts, indicators/proxies and data sources required for the physical measurement of ecosystem services; and pricing and valuation approaches amenable to information and data constraints in DMCs. The reviews will provide a basis for pilot projects under Outputs 1 and 2. Knowledge generated will also be shared regionally through publications, workshops and web-based materials. Knowledge generation, DMC capacity strengthening, and pilot projects will be supported through the establishment/strengthening of partnerships and knowledge networks with key global, regional and local organizations, including academic groups, national and regional organizations, non-government organizations (NGOs) and programs by other development partners. South-south knowledge exchange will also be promoted and supported. Knowledge dissemination strategies will include support for regional knowledge sharing events and products. Country level capacity building and institutional strengthening will be linked to pilot activities under Outputs 2 and 3. Final knowledge products from the TA are expected to include: (i) case studies and policy briefs on ecosystem service valuation, conservation and carbon financing, and country mainstreaming progress and approaches; and (ii) guidance notes and training modules on the ecosystem service assessments within ADB country programing and project level economic assessments will be prepared in collaboration with ADB's Economic Research Department (ERD). Training will include: identification of ecosystem services and benefits; impact of conversion or degradation on service delivery; practical methods, tools and data requirements, and integration of ecosystem service valuation in project level economic analysis. (ii) Improved assessment and mapping of ecosystem service values for critical landscapes and seascapes. In order to support capacity development and wider testing of ecosystem system service assessments, the project will support assessment and spatial mapping of ecosystem services and values in ecosystem landscape and/or seascapes in the Asia-Pacific region. Up to four assessments will be undertaken (linked to Output 3 below). Support for these assessments will be provided on a demand basis through close cooperation with ADB regional departments and DMCs. Ideally, the assessments will link with ongoing or planned projects and initiatives, where additional resources for ecosystem service assessments can provide a catalyst to the establishment of PES/REDD-plus mechanisms; and/or support identified policy, strategy and planning processes in DMCs. Selection criteria for project support will be developed and are expected to include the following: (i) decree of linkage with ongoing and planned projects and initiatives; (ii) targeting of thematic gaps for ecosystem service assessments; (iii) opportunities for scale-up and replication; (iii) countries or target areas with limited past support; and (iv) opportunities for community benefits and poverty reduction. Project support will include technical advisory services by consultants and resources and additional analytical studies where needed. (iii) Piloting the integration of ecosystem service values and financing mechanisms into projects and planning. Building on Output 2, the project will support the integration of ecosystem service values into decision-making processes through pilot activities at 3 levels: (i) integration within preparation of an ADB country partnership strategy (CPS), through links with country environment analysis/country environment notes (CEA/CEN) and relevant sector papers (1 pilot); (ii) integration within national / sector level policy or spatial planning processes at the DMC level (1 pilot); and (iii) integration at the project level, particularly in support of project preparation and economic analysis, including analysis of economic internal rates of return (EIRR) (2 pilots). The activities will be undertaken through participatory processes with DMCs in target countries in order to increase capacity and ownership. Each of the four pilots will include assessments of options for establishing financial mechanisms through PES, REDD-plus or other financial mechanisms. Participatory planning processes will evaluate opportunity costs and trade-offs, green growth opportunities within the given strategic planning or project context. At least four pilots will be undertaken and will be selected through consultation with regional departments. It is also expected that project level assessments will be undertaken in collaboration with ADB's Economic Research Department (ERD), with a view to drawing lessons on the integration of ecosystem service assessments in project level economic analysis.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/44141-012/main,06 Dec 2013,1070000.0,0,2013,"Agriculture, natural resources and rural development",Yes

Regional,Regional,"Asia Regional Integration Center, Phase V","The Strategy 2020 has identified nine leading challenges facing Asia; two of them are RCI related. First, while intraregional trade accounts for 56% of the region's total trade, much of this is confined to East Asia, with other subregions South Asia and the Pacific island countries in particular only starting to develop their trade and investment ties with Asia. Second, the region's savings are also not intermediated in the region, limiting the amount of capital invested in long-term projects such as infrastructure. Therefore, more RCI is needed to address these development challenges. By expanding trade and investment, strengthening capital market development and linkages, and investing in transportation and information connectivity, RCI can raise a country's growth potential. It can also reduce development gaps by allowing smaller and low-growth countries to tap regional supply chains and financial markets. Strategy 2020 has also identified RCI as one of its key development agenda. In turn, it has raised the importance of exploiting the potential benefit of RCI activities for accelerating economic growth, raising productivity and employment, reducing economic disparities, and achieving closer policy coordination and collaboration. ADB continues to support RCI work by providing financial assistance to RCI-related programs and projects, producing and disseminating RCI knowledge products, working with regional and international institutions to foster greater cooperation and consultation, and extending technical assistance to implement RCI programs. Since 2006, the ADB has financially supported a regional Technical Assistance (TA) for the Asia Regional Integration Center (ARIC) to enhance the capacity of key RCI stakeholders to promote greater regional integration by: (i) providing access to timely and relevant knowledge and information on RCI; (ii) facilitating regional economic monitoring and policy dialogues; and (iii) supporting research and publication work on RCI. Over the past six years, ARIC has become a reliable source of knowledge and information on RCI. Its key publications the Asia Recovery Report, Asia Economic Monitor (AEM), and Asian Economic Integration Monitor (AEIM) have assisted ADB DMC policymakers increase their awareness and knowledge on RCI trends and issues. They have also been recognized by top-tier media like Reuters, Financial Times, BBC, CNBC, and Bloomberg as reliable source of economic and RCI information. In particular, the AEIM is the only publication in Asia that tracks the progress of regional integration in the region. It also discusses key issues such as infrastructure connectivity, labor mobility, the cost and benefit of integration, and approaches to unraveling the Asian _noodle bowl_. ARIC has also supported the ASEAN+3 economic monitoring and policy dialogue process through its report on Economic Prospects, Risks, and Policy Issues for the informal meeting of ASEAN+3 Finance and Central Bank Deputies. ARIC has trained DMC policymakers on the early warning system, which have strengthened the capacities of member countries to spot, assess and mitigate economic and financial vulnerabilities emanating from global shocks. Its databases Macroeconomic and Financial, FTA and Integration Indicators have become authoritative data source on regional economic integration. Its RCI seminar, RCI Working Paper Series and collaboration with other regional institutions (ASEAN, APEC, and AMRO) has fostered greater knowledge sharing and collaboration.Today, the ARIC website attracts around 95,000 unique visitors with over 700,000 page views. Over 440 organizations ranging from multilateral, regional, academic, government, media and the private institutions have embedded links to the ARIC website. These include the ASEAN, World Bank, OECD, WTO, ILO, UN, Harvard, Monash, Berkely, National University of Singapore, Bloomberg, Reuters, Wall Street Online, India Times, US Treasury, Korean Development Institute, Thailand Department of Trade Negotiations, East Asia Forum, among others. The ARIC website has also been accessed in over 170 countries in 2012, with an average of 4,500 visits from the top 10 countries the Philippines, India, United States, Singapore, Republic of Korea, Thailand, Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Russia.To further promote greater RCI in the region, this TA will continue to produce knowledge and information products to track recent trends and thinking regarding salient RCI trends and issues. A key priority of the TA is to further improve the Asian Economic Integration Monitor by improving the online RCI indicator system that will track the progress of regional integration. It will also support a number of RCI-related research on infrastructure connectivity, labor mobility, crisis and regionalism, drivers and derailers of RCI, and RCI and South-South cooperation. The TA will also incorporate infrastructure indicators in its database so as to track the degree of physical connectivity in the region. To promote greater knowledge sharing and policy dialogue, the TA will also organize RCI seminars (policy consultations and round-table) in various parts of the region. Given that the risk from the global financial and Eurozone crises continues, the TA will continue to monitor macroeconomic interdependence in the region.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/47328-001/main,06 Dec 2013,1500000.0,0,2013,Finance,No

Regional,Regional,Supporting the Cities Development Initiative for Asia,"The TA is consistent with ADB's Strategy 2020 with its focus on support for infrastructure development for achieving environmentally sustainable growth and also with ADB's Urban Operational Plan, which emphasizes integrated urban investments. The CDIA received 20 requests for support in the first quarter of 2013. However, the current funding is limited compared with the demand placed by DMC cities for CDIA support, including some of the programmed activities. Therefore, additional resources are required to continue current activities as well as expand activities to meet the growing demand for CDIA services. Recognizing the need to strengthen mechanisms to assist medium-sized cities in preparing and financing sustainable urban infrastructure investment projects, the CDIA is engaging with relevant partner organizations and support them in delivering high-quality outputs to benefit cities. With the emphasis on _linkage to finance_ in the CDIA Strategy and Business Plan, two key areas include increasing private sector participation in urban infrastructure provision through the use of public private partnerships (PPPs) and stimulating pro-poor investments. This RETA is proposed to facilitate channeling of development partners contributions to support CDIA activities. The impact of the TA is improved management of cities in ADB's DMCs by increasing the number of urban infrastructure projects ready for detailed assessment (project preparatory TA) and subsequent funding by ADB and CDIA partners. The outcome of the TA is improvement in operational support to management in Asian cities and improvement in ADB's policy dialogue, relevance, and responsiveness to the demands of ADB's DMCs. The proposed TA will support CDIA to strengthen its sustainable urban development orientation. This will include maintaining a core management team capable of administering the program well, and providing outreach to cities and national and regional urban development partners. The TA will fund (i) interactions with cities as they develop their CDIA programs and select focus areas for interventions; (ii) liaison with potential project funding partners; (iii) supervision of city interventions; (iv) consultant resources for undertaking project development for city interventions; and (v) capacity development to strengthen city institutions for future project development and improved implementation.

People's Republic of China,East Asia,Institutionalization of Urban-Rural Environmental Master Planning to Guide Environmentally Sustainable Urbanization in the PRC,"The policy advisory technical assistance (TA) will study the institutionalization of Urban-Rural Environmental Master Planning (UREMP) in the People's Republic of China (PRC). UREMP will address key environmental issues and enable an environmentally sustainable model for the PRC's future urban development. UREMP is conceptualized as a required, legally binding instrument prior to and providing input for the development of land-use plans and urban master plans. UREMP will include urban-rural ecosystems analysis and landscape planning, and be prepared using domestic and international state-of-the-art methods. The Ministry of Environmental Protection of the PRC, the executing agency of the TA, has initiated a preliminary version of a management and technical support document for UREMP and this TA will build on and improve it into a technical and policy instrument that will suitably position UREMP within the PRC''s environmental and planning system. Four main outputs will be produced during implementation of the TA: (i) best practices case studies and analysis of the PRC environmental planning and regulatory system, lessons learned, and recommendations for the PRC; (ii) technical guidebook; (iii) policy recommendations and outline for technical support structure including regulatory and legal framework and proposal for institutional arrangement; (iv) training and advisory support to three cities which will pilot implementation of UREMP. The expected impact of the TA will be improved ecosystems preservation and urban-rural planning processes contributing to a more environmentally sustainable urbanization and urban-rural ecosystems services in the PRC. The expected outcome will be policy recommendations for consideration to the PRC's 13th Five-Year Plan.The key development issues to be addressed are:(i) Environmental degradation limits further urban development. Air and water pollution, loss of natural habitat and functioning ecosystems due to rapid urbanization are constraining further urban development and a more sustainable model is needed. (ii) Ignoring ecosystems services increases environmental risks. Cities are exposed to several environmental risks. Spatial planning and land-use change resulting from PRC urban expansion have not adequately considered the carrying capacities of environments and ecosystem functions and services. Optimal green spaces provide services including, (a) absorbing air and water pollutants, (b) cooling down temperatures in summer, and (c) retaining and absorbing stormwater, thus reducing flood risk and flood severity. (iii) Current environmental planning system is unable to address all the needs. The current environmental planning system has not been able to solve some of the key spatial and structural planning challenges described above due to predominance of economic factors in planning.(iv) To respond to this need, the MEP initiated a preliminary version of a management and technical support document for UREMP, and 24 cities in the PRC tested it. The outcome showed some encouraging results. However, significant weaknesses were revealed. The TA will build on and improve the preliminary version of UREMP technical and policy document, and support the MEP to test it in three pilot cities through training and advisory support.(v) UREMP is conceptualized as a required, legally binding instrument providing input for the development of land-use plans and urban master plans.

Myanmar,South East Asia,Support for Strengthening Public Debt Management,"The Government's Framework for Economic and Social Reforms recognizes that _maintaining a stable macroeconomic framework is the first order of reforms essential for achieving the overall reform agenda_ and that sound public financial management (including public debt management) will be critical to ensuring this. Similarly, ADB's Interim Country Partnership Strategy for Myanmar identifies support for an enabling economic environment as a core priority including support for reforms that focus on fiscal sustainability, macroeconomic stability, and strengthening public finance. In recognition of the urgent need for support in this area within the context of Myanmar's reintegration with the international community and an extensive reform program (and related financing requirements), initial support has been provided under an SSTA approved in 2012 (Improving Fiscal Revenue Mobilization). This has allowed for timely support for critical functions primarily focusing on basic capacity building of the foreign exchange and external debt division within the Budget Department in the Ministry of Finance. This initial support, however, is due to end by September 2013.

Tajikistan,Central and West Asia,Golovnaya 240-Megawatt Hydropower Plant Rehabilitation Project,"The proposed Project will increase supply of renewable energy to national and regional power systems. The Project will refurbish electric and mechanical equipment for power generation at Golovnaya Hydropower Plant (HPP) in Tajikistan. This will increase availability of year-round clean power for domestic sales and for export to Afghanistan. The Project will increase the generation capacity and operational efficiency of the power plant. The total installed generation capacity of Tajikistan is 5,055 MW. A large share of hydro generation (98%) is impacted by hydrology fluctuation and results in summer surplus and winter deficit. The power assets in Tajikistan have aged beyond their economic life. The maintenance has been kept at insufficient level due to non availability of spare parts and lack of funding at the vertically integrated state power utility Barki Tojik. The power sector regional master plan, prepared in 2012 under the Central Asian Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC), identified that nearly 80% of all generation and transmission assets in the country need to be replaced in order to meet the demand and eliminate winter deficit. The master plan identified rehabilitation of Golovnaya HPP as a priority generation project. ADB Country Partnership Strategy 2010-2014 defines the rehabilitation of existing hydro power plants as one of the key areas for intervention. The reliable and secured operation of the large generation plant and high voltage transmission network is equally important for reliability of interconnected neighboring grid and is a prerequisite for power tradeThe impact of the Project will be increased supply of renewable energy to national and regional power systems from 743 GWh in 2012 to 1,130 GWh in 2026.

India,South Asia,Madhya Pradesh Power Transmission and Distribution System Improvement Project,"Madhya Pradesh power transmission and distribution system served a peak demand of 8,505 megawatt (MW) and delivered 41,392 gigawatt hours (GWh) in 2012. However, the estimated peak demand was 9,151 MW, resulting in an unmet energy demand of 8,393 GWh (20% of the requirement). There are 8.21 million electricity customers in the state, of which 6.1 million were household customers with a legal power connection, representing about 60% of all households. New power connections are provided to households under a number of programs, and consumption per customer is also expected to increase in the face of robust economic growth in the state. Therefore, the demand for electricity is expected to increase and meeting this growing demand requires upgrading and expansion of the transmission and distribution network in the state.Quality of power supply and reliability of service in MP used to be substantially below the standards expected of a modern public electricity network. The Asian Development Bank (ADB), other development partners, and the government undertook a series of investments for expansion, upgrading and reconfiguration of the transmission and distribution networks since 2001. The ADB alone has approved about $1.37 billion worth of investment projects since 2001, mainly for transmission and distribution improvements. The government's own programs includes: (i) Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana (RGGVY) program for rural electrification; (ii) the Restructured Accelerated Power Development Reforms Program (R-APDRP), to improve electricity distribution infrastructure in urban areas; and (iii) Feeder Separation Program to limit agricultural supply to 8 hours and to provide rural households with 24-hour power supply.

Mongolia,East Asia,Payment System Modernization Project,"The current payments system is composed of an interbank payment infrastructure and a retail payment infrastructure. The former covers the real time gross settlement system (RTGS) for high-value transactions and the low-value payments system (LVPS) for low value transactions. It also covers the auctioning and trading of foreign exchange and securities, although the present system does not cover collateral management nor the pledging of securities/bonds. This includes a General Ledger system that is now outdated and needs to be integrated with participating banks statutory accounts with BOM. The retail payment infrastructure is based on the Electronic Transfer System (ETS) system acquired by BOM and covers electronic fund transport at point of sale / automatic teller machine (EFTPOS/ATM) switching but it can also support card and merchant management and EMV (Europay, Mastercard and Visa) and hybrid cards. To be able to accommodate these however, the ETS needs to be upgraded.The current system was built with support from the World Bank under its Financial Capacity Development Project completed in 2009 and considered one of its successful interventions under the project. However, it was recognized even at the close of the project that the payments system needs to undergo further development as market requirements evolve and due to technical limitations of the system as well as to address policy issues that emerge. The issues that need to be addressed include: (i)ability of the current software to accept future expansion of services and reliance of the current system on the current application provider for upgrade and maintenance; (ii)design of an open, flexible, modular architecture that can accommodate the introduction of new electronic payment services, as well as money and capital market instruments that suit evolving market needs and provide transparency, reduction of cash circulation in a modern broadband connected environment; (iii)development of an Eco System which ensures interoperability and competitiveness between service providers that may be implemented by competing institutions to avoid fragmented services and avail of scale economies; (iv)develop local standards and authentication procedures that more appropriately meet local requirements aligned with prescribed international standards; (v)set-up business continuity and disaster management plan to address system vulnerabilities such as network and system failure (computer crashes) and computer hacking, among others; and not the least; and(vi)establish an appropriate legal/regulatory framework that provides for the use of digital signatures, conduct of electronic payments, etc. and required authorities for oversight and supervision, market discipline and transparent rules.

India,South Asia,Jaipur Metro Rail Line 1-Phase B Project,"Jaipur, the capital of the Indian state of Rajasthan, is the 10th largest city and one of the fastest growing cities in India. It is a center of both traditional and modern industries, and is a very popular tourist destination for cultural heritage and historic architecture. The population of Jaipur city was 3.1 million in 2011, and it is projected to reach 8.1 million by 2031. The fast-paced industrial and commercial development has resulted in a steep rise in travel demand, but the city''s existing public transport infrastructure is inadequate in terms of capacity and service. With the growing economy, passengers are shifting to private modes of transport, as evident in the rise in vehicle ownership, aggravating congestion and pollution. The modal share for public transport was 19% in 2009, one of the lowest in cities with more than 3 million inhabitants in India.In 2009, Jaipur Development Authority developed a comprehensive mobility plan, seeking to provide an overall transport plan, up to 2031, that emphasizes the preeminence of public transport for the movement of people, not just vehicles, and integrating land use with transport networks. It prioritized mobility corridors, which can be utilized to optimize movement of people, focusing on mass transport, rather than vehicular traffic; and identified solutions including bus fleet augmentation, bus rapid transit system, and a high-capacity rail-based system (metro). The city bus fleet has been augmented with modern buses and the bus rapid transit system is being introduced. However, the main road corridors cannot accommodate segregated bus lanes, while the city's radial development pattern is generating high demand for trips to and from the central business and commercial districts. To meet the increasing mobility requirement and avoid further congestion, high capacity metro lines were recommended along the city's two backbone arterial corridors. These consist of Line 1 for the eastwest corridor of 12 km from Mansarovar to Badi Chopar, and Line 2 for the northsouth corridor of 23 km from Ambabadi to Sitapura. The metro lines are mainly elevated along the major arterial roads and underground beneath the city''s busy central zone.In January 2010, the government of Rajasthan established the Jaipur Metro Rail Corporation (JMRC) as a special purpose vehicle to implement the metro rail lines. Line 1-Phase A (9.7 km elevated portion from Mansarovar to Chandpole), estimated to cost about $400 million and financed entirely by the government, was completed in 2014 and began commercial operation in June 2015. The proposed ADB loan is to help finance Line 1-Phase B, consisting of the 2.3 km underground portion from Chandpole to Badi Chopar, with two stations for completion and operation by early 2018. Line 2 for the northsouth corridor is being planned, and the proposed financing includes consulting services for JMRC to update the detailed project report, which includes updating traffic demand, reviewing route selection, the preliminary engineering and cost estimate, and assessing economic and financial viability. It will help JMRC identify viable financing options and implementation arrangements to take the next steps toward achieving comprehensive improvements for the mass rapid transit system in Jaipur.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/46417-001/main,30 Jun 2014,119260000.0,0,2014,Transport,Yes

India,South Asia,Kolkata Environmental Improvement Investment Program - Tranche 1,"Kolkata is the largest city in the state of West Bengal and the seventh largest in India. It has a population of 4.5 million and contributes at least 13% of West Bengal''s gross domestic product. The city is and will remain the dominant commercial and financial hub in the state. Although its livability has improved, the quality of basic urban services remains below national standards. The gap is particularly noticeable in water supply and sewerage services in regard to coverage, continuity, and quality. This affects the city''s ability to attract investment, facilitate trade, and create jobs, as well as its productivity, its competitiveness, and, most importantly, its quality of life and welfare. Investment and policy gaps hinder how effectively and efficiently institutions deliver services, and how well the policy framework creates an enabling environment for better service delivery and sustainability. These limitations have been manageable, but Kolkata''s expanding economy and deficient investment and maintenance over the years have made narrowing the gaps more urgent. The Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC), created to administer the city under the KMC Act in 1980, is responsible for delivering water and sewerage services. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been working with KMC since 2000, but only regarding sewerage._The partnership has yielded good results. KMC has a strategy, sector road map, policy framework, and investment plan to address gaps in operational efficiency, institutional effectiveness, policy, and sustainability._The investment program combines physical and other investments. KMC wants ADB to continue its role as a key financing and advisory partner.The Project proposed for financing under the Periodic Financing Request will deliver three outputs: (i) Inefficient water supply assets rehabilitated;(ii) Sewerage and extension to peripheral areas continued; and(iii) Financial and project management capacity further developed.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/42266-023/main,30 May 2014,69500000.0,0,2014,Water and other urban infrastructure and services,Yes

People's Republic of China,East Asia,Strategy and Policy Study for Integrated and Balanced Development in the Northern Subregion of Anhui Province,"Three decades of successful reforms have transformed the People's Republic of China (the PRC) into the world's second largest economy and facilitated a swift transition from a low-income to a middle-income country. However, the PRC still faces complex development challenges, including significant poverty, large income inequality, and widening regional disparities. Failure to decisively implement further reforms would jeopardize the PRC's long-term growth prospects.The above-mentioned challenges also exist in Anhui province (Anhui). The province is located in the PRC's central region, with a population of 68 million and a territory of 134,000 square kilometers. When market reforms started in the late 1970s Anhui piloted a rural household contract responsibility system, which catalyzed the success of the agrarian reform in the PRC. The province has pioneered other initiatives, including the abolition of agricultural taxes and other fiscal charges on farmers. However, compared to its coastal neighbor provinces, Anhui has a less developed economy, a weaker urban-rural integration, wider disparity among sub-regions, and a higher poverty incidence.  Sub-regional disparity is of great concern of the provincial government. Anhui stretches across the Yangtze River. The province is divided into three sub-regions in the north, the south, and the middle of Anhui. The middle sub-region is an urban corridor along Yangtze River and the most prosperous and dynamic part of Anhui. The southern mountainous sub-region includes the Huangshan mountains, a world famous tourism site. For that reason, this sub-region has successfully implemented a development strategy concentrated on tourism. The northern sub-region of Anhui (NSRA), covering six cities and five counties, has lagged behind in terms of social and economic development. Compared to the two other sub-regions, NSRA faces more serious development constraints. Further, a consensus has yet to evolve among stakeholders on a suitable development strategy for the sub-region. The constraints include:Overpopulation and low productivity. NSRA's population density is well above the province's average. NSRA has 53 per cent of the province's population, but produces only 33 per cent of its GDP. Most of the residents are farmers with limited education and skills. Frequent floods. NSRA is located in the Huai River basin. Rather than being the driver of economic development as in other sub-regions, the river constraints development due to frequent water disasters.Less-developed transportation infrastructure. The water transportation along Huai River is under developed, as measured against its potential, the development goal of the national water transportation network, and market demand. NSRA also lacks railways to connect its economic centers. While there are expressways going through the sub-region, NSRA is short of connecting roads. Low urbanization. NSRA is a major grain producer in the province, but its per capita area of land is well below the provincial average, due to the high population density. Limited land constrains urbanization. NSRA urbanization rate is about 40 percent, much lower than the average of Anhui province. Lagged industrialization. NSRA is endowed with rich natural resources, particularly mineral resources. This is why the development of natural resources rather than industrial development was prioritized in the past. The expected impact will be reduced sub-regional disparity in Anhui province. The performance targets/indicators include that (i) the urbanization rate increases one percentage point annually by 2019 and (ii) investments in public infrastructure increase by 20 percent annually by 2019.The expected outcome will be an improved enabling policy and legal environment for integrated development in NSRA. As a performance target/indicator, policy recommendations under the TA will be incorporated into the province's new policy and planning documents issued during 2014-2017.The expected output will be a comprehensive report on promoting social and economic development in NSRA. The report will comprise an overview report and six sub-reports on migrant farmers, flood management, transportation, rural land transfer, industrialization, and urbanization. In addition, short policy notes, summarizing findings and recommendations, and knowledge products will be prepared during TA implementation. Review workshops and dissemination seminars involving stakeholders concerned will be organized at different stages of the TA.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/47077-001/main,21 Oct 2013,400000.0,0,2013,Public sector management,No

Although the NSDW has contributed to double Chongqing's gross domestic product (GDP) in the past five years, economic benefits have been unevenly distributed due to Chongqing's topographical characteristics of vast hinterlands and predominantly hilly and mountainous terrain. In Chongqing, a few rapidly developing central districts co-exist with poverty-stricken peripheral counties, and widening development gaps among districts and counties. Within districts and counties, imbalanced socioeconomic development is also increasingly evident where urban expansion meets rural areas. The urban-rural average income gap increased to 3.4 times in 2010 and 1.45 million people live below the designated poverty line of CNY1,400 per annum.In accordance with the national and municipal strategic priorities, Chongqing has shifted its focus from traditional centralized urban development to balanced urban-rural development. However, many rural villages, small towns and cities still struggle with poor basic infrastructures.

Naryn cascade accounts for 97% of the hydro capacity and 78% of the total installed power generation capacity in the country. Toktogul HPP is the region's only multi-year storage capacity. Producing 50% of the average electricity output, the power plant plays a critical role as a domestic power source and as a power exporter and provider of frequency regulator services to the Central Asian power system (CAPS). CAPS comprises the synchronously interconnected systems of Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Uzbekistan. Tajikistan, previously connected to CAPS, is currently operating on an island mode.Open Joint Stock Company (OJSC) Electric Power Plants (EPP), the state-owned generation company, wishes to implement the complete rehabilitation of the Toktogul HPP as recommended by the PPTA Study of Hydropower Plants on Naryn Cascade (PPTA Study for Phase 1). Toktogul HPP has been in service since 1975 with no significant rehabilitation or modernization work having been undertaken. Critical equipment is failing, resulting in availability dropping to 80%. It is considered that availability rates will continue to drop in the absence of rehabilitation. Phase 1 has been initiated covering critical secondary mechanical and electrical equipment that are becoming unreliable and unsafe to operate. The implementation consultant has been fielded. The contract award is expected by early 2014. In 2001, the state-owned utility was unbundled into one generation, one transmission, four electricity distribution companies, and one district heating company. This unbundled sector structure remains in effect today. Various privatization initiatives have been conducted with insignificant success following a negative social reaction.

People's Republic of China,East Asia,Eco-Compensation Mechanism and Policy Framework Study for the Xiangjiang River Watershed of the Chang-Zhu-Tan City Cluster,"The proposed policy and advisory technical assistance (TA) was requested from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) during the 2012 country programming review mission by the Governemnt of the People's Republic of China (PRC) through the Hunan Provincial Chang- Zhu- Tan (CZT) Resource-Conserving and Environment-Friendly Society Office Office (RES) of the Hunan provincial government. The environmental status and threats to water quality and abundance in the Xiangjiang river watershed will be analyzed to help develop a specific eco-compensation mechanism and policy. Economic analyses will help prioritize recommendations concerning environmentally sustainable natural resource and land use necessary for the implementation of an eco-compensation scheme. A TA reconnaissance mission was conducted on 15-18 March 2013. The TA supports the Twelfth Five-Year Plan (2011- 2015) of the PRC which emphasizes the importance of environmentally sustainable growth, and the Hunan provincial development and national strategies up to 2050 that included targets for low carbon sustainable growth and protected areas. The TA also supports the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to which the PRC is a signatory. The TA is aligned with the Asian Development Bank''s (ADB) country partnership strategy (2011- 2015) for the PRC, supporting the government sector objective for natural resources and agriculture. The TA will address important objectives of the ADB's Water Operational Plan (WOP) 2011- 2020, including policy reform (WOP, para. 3.12) and watershed development (WOP, para. 3.25). The Water Financing Partnership Facility (WFPF) funds will directly contribute to three target outcomes of the Water Financing Program: _500 million people provided access to safe water supply and improved sanitation,_ _integrated water resources management introduced in 30 river basins,_ and _improved water governance though national water reforms and capacity development._ ADB Loan 2962-PRC, approved on 7 December 2012, focuses on an inland waterway transport project on this river; and this activity will complement the loan by helping maintain local hydrological cycles. The TA was included in ADB's country operations business plan (2013- 2015) for nonlending products and services for the PRC in 2013. The impact of the TA will be the improved environmental quality in the Xiangjiang river watershed of CZT city cluster. The outcome will be a strengthened eco-compensation mechanism and policy framework to improve water quality and abundance in the Xiangjiang river watershed. The TA will have three outputs: (i) completed analyses of environmental threats to water quality and abundance, including their interrelationship with natural resource and land use in the Xiangjiang river watershed, (ii) recommendations for the design and implementation of an eco-compensation mechanism and policy framework, and (iii) strengthened government capacity in the environmentally sustainable use of natural resources and land to improve water quality and abundance. The TA is estimated to cost $725,000, of which (i) $400,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources); and (ii) $225,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Multi-Donor Trust Fund under the WFPF administered by ADB.

Bhutan,South Asia,Piloting the Design of e-Services Delivery Platform in Health Services,"1. The Royal Government of Bhutan (the Government) has identified information and communications technology (ICT) based e-governance as a key area for improving efficiency and enabling wider reach of public service delivery. The focus of the Government is to enhance gross national happiness by building a knowledge society empowered by ICT. The Government is taking a dual approach to achieve this namely by (i) furthering efficiency building measures through ICT and (ii) developing ICT related sectors for exports and local consumption. 2. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has undertaken discussions with the Government to explore opportunities for providing support to strengthen e-governance activities in the area of efficiency improvement by establishing an e-Services platform through a pilot initiative to deliver public services. The Government has recommended starting the pilot in the health sector by offering services such as telemedicine and basic medical laboratory testing facilities through e-Health centers. The proposed category B, small-scale capacity development technical assistance will finance the pilot establishment of an e-Services delivery platform in the area of e-Health in Bhutan in collaboration with private sector participants. 3. ADB, as part of its strategy to enhance sustainable development in its developing member countries, encourages private sector participation where possible in its developmental initiatives. Thus, for this initiative ADB is seeking to collaborate with and leverage resources through corporate social responsibility programs of private sector corporations, - Hewlett-Packard (HP) and Microsoft. ADB will liaise and facilitate with the two private entities in bringing together the needed hardware, software, implementation services, and subsequent knowledge transfer for maintenance of the pilot components to the Government agencies namely, the Ministry of Health (MoH) and the Ministry of Information and Communications (MoIC).

Kazakhstan,Central and West Asia,"Joint Government of Kazakhstan and the Asian Development Bank Knowledge and Experience Exchange Program, Phase 1","The value of innovative strategic knowledge solutions and global best practices are accepted as crucial factors for socioeconomic advancement. For Kazakhstan, this is underscored in the country's Kazakhstan-2030 and Kazakhstan-2050 strategies. The country partnership strategy (CPS), 2012-2016 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) establishes demand-based knowledge products and services as important tools with which ADB can add value to Kazakhstan's development. These strategic documents highlight the need for Kazakhstan to effectively apply knowledge solutions and global best practices so as to become a more diversified, competitive, and inclusive economy and go beyond the middle income country stage.Against this background, and recognizing ADB's extensive experience in knowledge management across Asia and the Pacific, the Government of Kazakhstan (government) and ADB agreed to establish the joint Knowledge and Experience Exchange Program (KEEP) in 2013. The KEEP is designed to facilitate a range of strategic knowledge solutions and global best practices that will enable Kazakhstan to respond to current and future development opportunities and challenges in a well-informed and timely manner. The KEEP is defined in a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the government and ADB. The MOU provides the framework (outlining the objective and scope, areas of focus, implementation arrangements, and monitoring and evaluation measures) and commits the parties to share the cost of a range of knowledge and experience-sharing activities; the total budget of the KEEP is $2.5 million. The ADB's participation in the KEEP is through three technical assistance (TA) operations. ADB financing in each of these TA operations complements 50% of the government's cost share. Phase 1 with an approved budget of $500,000 commenced in June 2013 after the signing of the MOU by the Minister of Economy and Budget Planning and ADB Vice-President. During implementation of subsequent Phases 2 and 3 financing of the KEEP increases up to $1.0 million per Phase.This policy and advisory TA finances Phase 1 of the KEEP in 2013-2016. The impact of this TA will be enhanced policy formulation capacity of the government to support its medium and long-term development strategies. The expected outcome will be strengthened government capacity and awareness of best practices in selected areas. As part of the KEEP, this TA supports subprojects at the macro, sector, and thematic levels that facilitate and promote knowledge solutions, capacity development, and exchange of global best practices. Due to a dynamic and unforeseeable nature of the government's demand for knowledge products and advisory services, the government and ADB agreed that a list of subprojects under the TA and the implementation approach will be flexible in order to allow the TA to effectively respond to the government's urgent requests in a timely manner. The criteria for selecting a subproject are that it (i) supports the government's priority policy reforms and is consistent with the CPS; (ii) is related to implementation of the government's development strategies; (iii) is considered as an urgent and high-priority area where ADB can add value; (iv) shows evidence of strong government ownership; and (v) complements ADB and development partners' other knowledge activities.The main outputs of the TA are under the categories of policy advisory and capacity development and include (i) analytical reports with policy recommendations for the government, and (ii) capacity development activities. Effective coordination of the TA by the executing agency and beneficiaries is important for successful implementation of the current and subsequent TAs under the KEEP. It is assumed that there will be (i) consistent government demand for ADB's knowledge products and services, (ii) effective coordination by the executing agency in leading selection of potential subprojects and re",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/47110-001/main,23 Aug 2013,500000.0,0,2013,Public sector management,No

People's Republic of China,East Asia,Shanxi Technical and Vocational Education and Training Development Project,"Located in the central region of the People's Republic of China (PRC), Shanxi is a less developed province with a population of 36 million. In 2011, Shanxi''s gross domestic product per capita ranked 18th in the PRC and 18.8% of Shanxi's rural dwellers lived below the national poverty line, significantly higher than the national average of 13.4%. As one of the PRC''s key energy and industrial bases, Shanxi has contributed to the energy supply and industrial development in the PRC. The province's key industries include coal, metallurgy, coal-fired power generation, and machinery. However, Shanxi''s resource-based economy is characterized by low-technology manufacturing, high energy consumption, and a significant contribution to environmental degradation. In 2010, the PRC State Council designated Shanxi as a national pilot reform zone for the transformation of a resource-based economy. This provides a significant opportunity to foster innovation and industrial upgrading, expand and modernize the services and agricultural sectors, and support an inclusive and environmentally sustainable growth. To achieve these objectives, Shanxi needs a multi-skilled workforce. Strengthening human resources through the development of technical and vocational education and training (TVET) is one of the key priorities under the PRC''s and Shanxi''s 12th Five-Year Plans, 2011-2015. Currently, Shanxi is facing a severe shortage of highly skilled workers in priority sectors and emerging areas. Under the provincial 12th Five-Year Plan, Shanxi is expected to further reduce the number of coal mining sites and to automate extraction in 70% of the coal mines. This planned technological upgrading and the need to ensure coal mining safety has resulted in a shortage of 200,000 highly skilled workers in the coal industry. In manufacturing, the provincial development plans emphasize renewable energy, biotechnology, new materials, and advanced equipment manufacturing, which are in line with national level strategic industries. To move up the value chain and diversify the production structure, it is essential to improve research and development capacity and to train high and medium skilled workers. Given Shanxi''s central geographic location, the province plans to accelerate development of the rail and air freight transport systems, multimodal transport hubs, and distribution and logistics centers to achieve an interconnected network. There is a demand for more skilled workers to further improve its logistics system. Further, with abundant cultural and natural heritage sites, Shanxi is well positioned to develop a modern tourism industry; however, a lack of skilled workers has been a constraint to further development of tourism. There is a need to retrain migrants and displaced workers from small coal mines to improve livelihoods.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/47029-001/main,05 Aug 2013,750000.0,0,2013,Education,No

Myanmar,South East Asia,Design of e-Governance Master Plan and Review of Information and Communication Technology Capacity in Academic Institutions.,"1. The outlook for Myanmar's economy is positive, bolstered by expected strong export earnings from resource based commodities and an increase in foreign direct investment. ADB forecasts the country's gross domestic product to grow from about 6.3% in 2012 to about 6.5% in 2013 and 6.7% in 2014. Myanmar has recently opened its engagement with rest of the world. Therefore, many sectors of the economy need revival and upgrade to adopt the globalization requirements to bring inclusive and environmentally sustainable growth. This requires enhancing e-Governance delivery and capacity for supporting systemic institution building activities in core economic sectors.2. In its efforts to improve public service delivery, the Government has focused on streamlining administrative processes and eliminating red tape. Usage of e-Governance is expected to play a significant role in this effort. In this regard, the Government has established an inter-ministerial task force for public services performance appraisal headed by a senior minister in the President's office and including representation at the deputy minister level from a range of key ministries. While the initiative will eventually be government-wide, it is initially focusing on key areas impacting the economy such as trade, investment, electricity, and telecommunications.3. One of the key issues facing the Government as it seeks to introduce ICT systems to help strengthen performance of public services is the lack of a coherent and systematic approach to the design, evaluation, and adoption of such systems. This presents a real risk that government agencies will adopt systems on an ad-hoc basis; and that such systems may prove inappropriate from a needs as well as cost perspective and incompatible in terms of being able to effectively share information with systems in other agencies. This issue is particularly acute at the moment as many development partners are offering support for ICT systems to line ministries who have in turn expressed an urgent need for such help. 4. A common framework is needed to guide the design, evaluation, and adoption of these systems in order ensure their cost-effectiveness, interoperability, appropriateness; and allow them to effectively support the government's reform efforts. Therefore, such ICT solutions will have to be undertaken comprehensively by way of developing an e-Governance master plan, identifying and satisfying demand systematically. 5. Parallel to this, review of ICT capacity in institutions of higher learning in the country for providing supply of skilled human resources to nurture and support e-Governance initiatives is essential. The strengthening of ICT capacity in institutions of higher learning is essential to sustain efforts on e-Governance. In fact, this is an integral part of an e-Governance master plan. The role of higher education in ICT discipline in the development of e-Governance system is imperative. The maturity of higher education in ICT discipline in the country is an indicator of the degree of prevalence of supporting environment for sustaining e-Governance initiatives. Typically this requires the uses of ICT educational assets, research in ICT, and the fostering of innovation in the implementation of an e-Governance program. 6. Higher learning institutions in Myanmar require significant digital accessibility and introduction of cost effective techniques to be current with ICT industry requirements. Therefore, institutional strengthening activities require a blend of capacity development activities as well as demonstration initiatives, such as exploring white space technology, e-library, e-learning, etc. Hence, the e-Governance approach encompasses the big picture development of e-Governance program for the country including strengthening the supply side through review of ICT capacity institutions of higher learning.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/47158-001/main,16 Aug 2013,500000.0,0,2013,Education,Yes

People's Republic of China,East Asia,Hunan Technical and Vocational Education and Training Demonstration Project,"The project will provide targeted support to 13 public TVET institutions in Hunan to strengthen the capability to deliver demand-driven quality programs related to priority industries. The project will build the capacity of IAGs and foster partnerships between 13 project TVET institutions and employers to jointly develop the skills needed in the workplace, and prepare graduates who are able to adjust to changing demands in the labor market quickly; modernize the curriculum by developing competency-based curriculum (CBC) in priority areas; upgrade the instructional capacity of vocational instructors and build TVET management capacity; strengthen market-oriented program planning through improved labor market information system (LMIS); and upgrade equipment and facilities in selected TVET institutions. Strategic fit. The project is the first Asian Development Bank (ADB)-financed lending project for TVET in the PRC and is envisaged to play a demonstration role for TVET development in the country. Because lack of worker skills and education are viewed as a constraint to the PRC''s inclusive growth, ADB involvement in the TVET sector is strongly justified. The project supports ADB''s education policy and education sector strategies and Strategy 2020._It aligns with ADB''s PRC country partnership strategy, 2011-2015_and supports the PRC''s 12th Five-Year Plan, which prioritizes developing high-quality human resources, increasing scientific and technological innovations, and accelerating educational reform. The project has the following demonstration features for replication in other provinces and autonomous regions of the PRC: (i) Enhancing industry involvement. The project will strengthen partnerships between TVET institutions and industries, and build the capacity of sector-specific IAGs in the priority sectors.(ii) Promoting inclusive technical and vocational education and training through information and communication technology. The project will broaden access for students from remote areas by developing online TVET courses, and thus foster sharing of teaching and learning resources among well-developed TVET institutions in urban areas and less-developed TVET institutions in poor and remote areas to benefit students in project and non-project TVET institutions. (iii) Greening technical and vocational education and training provision. The project will contribute to the Government of the PRC''s objectives of developing an environmentally sustainable and energy-efficient society under its 12th Five-Year Plan by designing, constructing, and maintaining teaching and learning buildings that reduce energy and water use, and promoting sustainable practices such as reducing, reusing, and recycling resources; encouraging the selection of training equipment with low energy consumption; and skills mapping to identify skills needed for environmentally sustainable development in Hunan.Incorporation of the lessons learned.

Sri Lanka,South Asia,Green Power Development and Energy Efficiency Improvement Investment Program,"In recent years Sri Lanka has improved its energy sector and achieved a national electrification ratio of 94% (2012) compared with 29% in 1990. But a longer-term challenge is to reduce its high dependence on expensive fossil fuel energy. The energy sector struggles to (a) meet growing demand for electricity at a low cost and acceptable reliability rates, and (b) attain long term sustainability. The share of thermal energy in the power generation mix has increased from 6% in 1995 to 54% in 2011 that creates a high energy cost base. Demand growth has been met by expensive oil-fired thermal plants. This is not the solution to the country's energy security and environment protection in the long term. Diversification of the generation mix, especially from renewable energy sources, improved network efficiency, and supply and demand side management is the only way to correct this situation. The transmission network also needs expansion and modernization, particularly in the former conflict-affected areas in Northern and Eastern provinces. Another challenge is to improve system reliability and cut technical losses. 33 kilovolt (kV) medium voltage (MV) network is needed to expand power supply into rural areas, where many of the poor households remain unconnected or have poor quality of supplies. The new energy agenda also targets more clean energy. This is yet another means to ensure sector sustainability in the long term. Finally, the government intends to pursue financial, managerial, and institutional reforms, in line with the Sri Lanka Electricity Act, 2009.The government intends to pursue cost recovery and expects that with the introduction of low-cost coal-fired generation it will be possible to address the current high cost of power generation and achieve cost recovery from 2018. As part of its cost recovery strategy, the government increased retail electricity tariffs by 35% on average in April 2013. While the government aims to increase supply capacity and replace expensive and inefficient oil-fired power plants by constructing the coal-fired plants, the remaining supply capacity will need to come from renewable sources (and conversion of the oil-fired plants to gas-fired plants). The 20% increase in power generation from non-conventional renewable sources will be in addition to the current 45% of the conventional hydropower and will ensure that most of electricity will be generated by domestic clean energy sources in the future. This will address the critical question about the energy security agenda.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/47037-002/main,06 Aug 2013,700000.0,0,2013,Energy,Yes
People's Republic of China,East Asia,Strengthening Capacity for Low-Carbon Development in Ningbo,"The CDTA will address the critical capacity gaps of NMG in designing and implementing a low-carbon development strategy through targeted package of policy, regulations, and financial incentives in promoting industrial energy efficiency and accelerate distributed renewable energy generation. The CDTA will also enhance NMG's capacity in structuring PPPs for clean energy investments through appropriate allocation of responsibilities and risks between private and public sector entities. The CDTA will identify technologies and industrial processes to achieve the benchmark energy efficiency levels and assist NMG in establishing a technology transfer mechanism through technology providers, such as energy service companies (ESCOs). Since the ESCOs have the right technical expertise on appropriate technologies but are constrained by access to debt financing, the CDTA will be developing innovative financial products and instruments and recommend the establishment of a dedicated financing platform to mobilize financing for energy efficiency projects implemented by ESCOs and SMEs overcoming prevailing barriers. If successful, it can be introduced and replicated in other parts of the PRC. Integration of distributed renewable energy sources poses a number of technical, institutional, and financial challenges for investments to flow in scattered but large number of small-scale renewable energy projects compared to a single large-scale project. The role of private investments in such projects cannot be emphasized enough. The proposed CDTA will review the current policy framework to introduce appropriate policy incentives through transparent regulatory regime, feed-in tariffs, and tax incentives to promote private sector investments through PPPs in distributed renewable energy.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/47055-001/main,01 Jul 2013,500000.0,0,2013,Energy,Yes

Myanmar,South East Asia,Support for Post-Primary Education Development,"The policy and advisory technical assistance (PATA) directly supports Myanmar's Comprehensive Education Sector Review (CESR), which is led by the Ministry of Education (MOE) coordinating involvement by relevant government agencies and support by multiple development partner organizations (DPOs). As the first rigorous and comprehensive assessment of the education sector in 2 decades, the CESR will be fundamentally important in helping the government more precisely pinpoint sector challenges and providing a strengthened evidence base for needed reforms and investments. In particular, the CESR process will culminate in the formulation (by around end of 2014) of a costed National Education Sector Plan (NESP) as unified framework for prioritized and sequenced investments by both the government and DPOs. The CESR process consists of 3 phases, focusing on: (i) rapid assessment (Phase 1), (ii) in-depth analysis (Phase 2), and (iii) NESP formulation (Phase 3). The NESP will include (i) a 1-year plan covering FY2015, and (ii) interim planning for education sector investments during FY2016- FY2020 and input into formulation of the national multisector Sixth Five-Year Plan.More specifically, the PATA directly supports MOE and other agencies in undertaking analysis, policy dialogue, and planning related to the post-primary education (PPE) subsectors consisting of the secondary education subsector (SES), technical and vocational education and training (TVET), and higher education subsector (HES) under the umbrella of the government-led, DPO-supported CESR. In particular, the PATA will provide flexible, needs-tailored support for in-depth analysis and policy dialogue and advice during CESR Phase 2, and formulation of viable PPE elements within the broader CESP to be approved at the end of Phase 3. Inputs under the PATA TA involve close cooperation with a small number of other DPOs supporting PPE-related elements of the CESR (e.g., GIZ and UNESCO), while support for secondary education curriculum reform is closely dovetailed with JICA support for primary education curriculum reform. More generally, the PATA is closely harmonized with and complement other DPOs' support (largely focused on primary, pre-primary, and nonformal education), and also complements and builds on foundational analysis, capacity development, and other front-end support under ongoing ADB capacity development technical assistance CDTA 8187-MYA (in partnership with Australia).",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/47177-001/main,16 Aug 2013,1700000.0,0,2013,Education,No

People's Republic of China,East Asia,Gansu Baiyin Urban Development II Project,"Baiyin is a medium-sized city in Gansu province (Gansu), one of the 12 less-developed provinces and autonomous regions targeted under the Western Development Strategy of the People's Republic of China (PRC). The city was originally established as a national copper mining base in the 1950s but its socioeconomic development suffered major setbacks after continuous copper exploitation and depletion, and environmental degradation. Since the Eleventh Five-Year Plan 2006 2010, Baiyin received special support from the national and provincial governments to jumpstart its industrial transformation. The goal was to transform Baiyin from a resource-exhausted mining city into a new industrial center through technology upgrading and diversification of existing production chains, while achieving efficient use of resources and reducing adverse impacts on the environment. In 2008, the Gansu Baiyin Urban Development Project (Phase I project) was approved by ADB, providing timely assistance on urban road construction and district heating supply to support the initial stage of economic diversification in two urban centers Baiyin district and Pingchuan district.The project will invest in key urban infrastructure and services to: (i) provide efficient water service for drinking and industrial processing; (ii) provide wastewater treatment to improve water management, environment, and locals' quality of life; (iii) strengthen vocational education and training capacity; (iv) enhance road safety and traffic management in central urban district; and (v) enhance environmental management for industrial transformation.

Uzbekistan,Central and West Asia,Advanced Electricity Metering Project Phase 2,"Following the progress of Asian Development Bank (ADB) financing on Advanced Electricity Metering Project, this phase 2 project will replicate and expand the advanced electricity metering (AEM) system that uses modern, accurate, and theft-proof revenue meters for the power grid system and the end-user in five new regions (Andijan, Ferghana, Kashkadarya, Namangan, and Surkhandarya). The project will help improve energy efficiency in the power distribution sector, by reducing commercial losses and improving the efficiency of electricity revenue collection. The project will include installation of 3.1 million meters and meter data management (MDM) system that includes billing and energy data management, and capacity development for operational improvement in reducing commercial losses. The economy has sustained high growth, averaging 8.5% since 2006. Growth in 2013 and beyond is expected to remain at 7.5-9%. The Government of Uzbekistan (the government) prioritizes modernizing industry and developing infrastructure and the private sector. Reliable and affordable electricity supply is vital to achieving these goals. One of the key challenges is the high level of commercial losses in the power sector. The state joint stock company Uzbekenergo, a vertically integrated utility fully owned by the government, estimates losses of 7.2% in transmission and 12.6% in distribution in 2011 (national average). Distribution losses in the targeted five regions ranged between 10.4% and 27.6% in 2011. The high level of commercial losses is caused by the lack of investment in modernizing the distribution assets together with outdated manual operation that results in inaccurate, unreliable and inefficient revenue collection. Electricity meters are generally old, inaccurate, and susceptible to tampering, but still in service beyond their designed economic life without proper recalibration. Without proper grid metering, Uzbekenergo faces difficulty in accounting for electricity use or identifying electricity tampered. Manual-based tariff collection operation and billing system are subject to inaccurate, inefficient, and ineffective accounting of revenue collection. Current incentive mechanism to reduce commercial losses is not sufficiently institutionalized. To overcome these challenges, Uzbekenergo has requested international financial institutions (IFIs) with ADB as the lead development partner to help implement and finance a nationwide AEM program. AEM, or _smart metering_ with digital meters, allows two-way communication between the utility and consumers. AEM enables the utility to remotely monitor and disconnect supply without sending reading personnel to the site. It provides consumers with power usage information more frequently. AEM can also help identify losses, reduce commercial losses, and improve tariff collection. Uzbekenergo aims at gradually covering all 6 million customers across the country. It has initiated its first large-scale AEM project financed by ADB, covering 1 million customers. The implementation consultant has been recruited, bidding has been launched, and prebid meeting was successfully held with participations from more than 20 firms. Based on the smooth implementation of the phase 1 project, Uzbekenergo has requested ADB to finance the second phase project covering five regions. The project follows ADB's strategy for Uzbekistan, which includes a focus on energy efficiency and reliable power supply.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/41340-014/main,25 Jun 2013,520000.0,0,2013,Energy,Yes
Kyrgyz Republic,Central and West Asia,Water Supply and Sanitation Strategy,"The proposed technical assistance (TA) is aimed at developing a rural WSS policy and institutional arrangement to address the weak rural Water Supply and Sanitation (WSS) sector governance, lack of rural WSS policy, poor project implementation and poor service delivery. The proposed TA will also support the creation of a robust governance framework for rural WSS. The government has recognized the above deficiencies and is still interested in improving WSS services in rural areas. The proposed TA focuses on the following four main areas:a. Synthesizing lessons learned for designing future development projects. A recent assessment of the rural WSS sector in the country identified various institutional, communication, and corruption issues that require to be addressed in order to ensure sustainable rural WSS service delivery. The proposed TA will build on this report by adding, to the existing lessons learned, the technical, project management and compliance perspective, experience from other development partner rural WSS projects, conducting a willingness-to-pay survey of rural population, and assessment of market for suppliers, consultants, and contractors. This will provide a more comprehensive insight into sector problems and a guide for designing future projects. b. Capacity development of rural WSS institutions. To fill the gap in rural WSS governance, the proposed TA will support the strengthening and capacity development of institutions involved in the provision of rural WSS services. This could be done by building capacity of existing institutions or by creating new institutions. The proposed TA will: (i) define the approach to filling the governance gap; (ii) design the rural WSS institutional framework, ranging from national level institutions down to service provision at village level; (iii) define the roles and responsibilities of these institutions; (iv) design mechanisms to minimize corruption, including incentives and compensation plans; (v) define capacity development needs of institutions; and (vi) deliver training essential for the rural WSS institutions to carry out their roles and responsibilities.c. Asses and monitor government demonstration projects. In order to improve project design and implementation, the government has identified a number of successful rural WSS subprojects that can be used as a model for future rural WSS projects. The proposed TA will assess these subprojects by: (i) conducting technical reviews of the designs and systems as constructed; (ii) gathering community feedback on the projects; and (iii) conducting a financial analysis of the projects to establish their sustainability. Furthermore, the government is planning rectification of some less successful subprojects to bring them to the same standard as the successful projects. The TA will monitor the rectification of the subprojects, including: (i) efficiency of project implementation and procurement; (ii) quality of design and construction; and (iii) technical and financial sustainability. Based on these two types of subprojects the proposed TA will identify the key success factors for rural WSS subprojects. These findings will be presented to rural WSS beneficiaries and stakeholders in a series of workshops designed to raise awareness of beneficiaries' role in making rural WSS subprojects successful. Furthermore, the identified key success factors will form the basis a rural WSS model to be used for the new rural WSS project. d. Prepare Rural WSS Policy and assist in its implementation. The proposed TA will prepare a Rural WSS Policy, which will follow the key elements of the National WSS Strategy prepared by the World Bank. The Rural WSS Policy will include: (i) regulatory and service monitoring mechanisms (including revised water quality standards); (ii) tariff and subsidy mechanisms; (iii) revised rural WSS technical standards (i.e. compatible with standards of international water associations); (iv) operations and maintenance plans and guidelines; (v) rural WSS asset ownership regulations; (vi) standardized design approach and procurement plans for rural WSS systems; (vii) benchmarking and information gathering program, (viii) WSS professionals training plan; and (ix) sector coordination, support and knowledge sharing plan. The Rural WSS Policy will create an enabling environment for the delivery of sustainable, quality WSS services at a reasonable cost.

India,South Asia,Madhya Pradesh Power Transmission and Distribution System Improvement Project,"Madhya Pradesh power transmission and distribution system encountered a peak demand of 8,505 megawatt (MW) and served 41,392 gigawatt/hour (GWh) resulting in an unmet peak demand of 8,393 MW (17%) in 2012. Forecast sales to all customers in 2013-2014 is about 43,000 GWh, (about 600 kWh per person) and sales are expected to increase by an average of 7% per year in the 12th five-year plan period (2012-2017). There are 8.21 million electricity customers in the state, of which 6.1 million were household customers with a legal power connection, representing about 60% of all households. The increasing new connections to households, increased consumption from existing customers, and the economic growth of the state, are expected to increase the demand for electricity. Meeting this growing demand requires upgrading and expansion of the transmission and distribution network in the state.Quality of power and reliability of service in MP are substantially below the standards expected of a modern public electricity network, and require improvement, with investments on upgrades and reconfiguration of the medium and low voltage distribution networks. The gap between supply and demand continues to be a concern, requiring load shedding throughout the year, which is likely to continue for a few years to come. The network losses are high, especially in rural areas where distribution lines are overloaded. Un-metered connections and theft have caused the rural area losses to be about 46% in 2011.

Tajikistan,Central and West Asia,Strengthening Tajikistan's Trade and Investment Regime,"Link to Country Partnership Strategy/Regional Cooperation Strategy: After twelve years of pursuing accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), Tajikistan finally became, on 2 March 2013, a full-pledged member of the WTO. Led by the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade (MEDT), the Tajikistan government recently drafted a strategic framework for post-WTO accession. In this regard, ADB has been requested by the Tajikistan government for support in the conduct of three key activities: (i) an international trade and investment conference to show that Tajikistan is _Open for Business_; (ii) policy research and analysis on organizational reform of the Standards Agency (Tajikstandart); and (iii) capacity-building on policy and regulatory reforms to effect organizational change and tackle technical barriers to trade. These activities were discussed during an ADB consultation mission on 3-5 March 2013 and deemed crucial to Tajikistan compliance with its WTO commitments and to its ability to ensure the country fully benefits from WTO accession and membership. The activities are also consistent with the strategic framework of the Tajikistan Country Partnership Strategy (CPS 2010-2014). Specifically, the TA activities will support CPS operational priorities in developing the private sector and improving public services, particularly for traders. The activities also support broader objectives in regional cooperation and integration and governance. The TA will build on the work of other donor-funded WTO-related initiatives, including USAID's Regional Trade Liberalization and Customs Project (which ended in 2011), the EU project on Technical Assistance to Support the Tajik Ministry of Economic Development and Trade in the WTO Accession Process (which ended in January 2013), and USAID's Regional Economic Cooperation Project (which is ongoing until late 2013).",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/44073-012/main,24 May 2013,225000.0,0,2013,Industry and trade,No
Cambodia,South East Asia,Third Financial Sector Program - Subprogram 2,"The sequence of financial reforms in Cambodia has been guided by the Government's 10-year FSDS. A project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) for $850,000 ($700,000 from ADB TASF IV) was approved in April 2010 to help the Government update the FSDS 2006-2015 and formulate the next cluster program. IMF and World Bank have recently completed the first financial sector assessment program (FSAP) on Cambodia that will provide useful inputs to the update of the 10-year FSDS. While FSP I has been rated successful by the independent evaluation department (IED), some of the reform measures were not widely enforced due to weak interministerial coordination and capacity constraint. Prepared within the framework of the updated FSDS, the next program cluster (FSP III) will help complete some of the reform programs that commenced during FSP II, strengthen the enforcement of completed activities, and commence reform activities in leasing, capital market, and pension fund. The expected overall impact of the cluster program is a sound, market-based finance sector to enhance mobilization of financial resources to support sustainable economic growth. The expected outcome of the FSP III is a growing, resilient, and efficient financial system. FSP III was approved in November 2011. The National Bank of Cambodia will be the Executing Agency, and the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) and Ministry of Commerce (MOC) will be the Implementing Agencies.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/42305-023/main,22 Nov 2013,15220000.0,0,2013,Finance,No

Myanmar,South East Asia,Power Transmission and Distribution Improvement Project,"Even though electricity consumption in Myanmar has doubled during the last 10 year, in 2011, total electricity consumption was 6,312 gigawatt-hour. With a population of about 60 million, Myanmar's per capita electricity consumption was only 100 kilowatt-hour (kWh) per year, which was the lowest among ASEAN 10 countries. The low national average per capita electricity consumption is due to the low electrification rate, low industrial development and lack of investment. The country's average electrification (defined as the number of electrified household connected to the grid over the total number of household) grew from about 16% in 2006 to 26% in 2011. Yangon City has the highest electrification ratio (67%), followed by Nay Pyi Taw (54%), Kayar (37%) and Mandalay (31%). The remaining rural areas are still poorly electrified averaging at about 16%. Currently, Myanma Electric Power Enterprise (MEPE) under the Ministry of Electric Power (MOPE) is responsible for the development and implementation of transmission network, covering the voltage levels of 66 kilovolt (kV), 132 kV and 230 kV.

Regional,Regional,"Developing Impact Evaluation Methodologies, Approaches, and Capacities in Selected Developing Member Countries (Subproject 1)","Impact evaluation (IE) is a cross-cutting theme that is relevant in all countries, sectors, and regions. Conducting impact evaluation for strategically selected interventions will help improve relevance and effectiveness of country and regional partnership strategies. Properly implemented impact evaluations will help in the proper selection of a strategic mix of effective interventions. By implementing impact evaluations of development interventions in the Asia-Pacific region, the proposed cluster TA will contribute to the creation of knowledge on what works in development, how it works, and why.The proposed cluster TA will comprise three sub-projects with each sub-project covering 4 to 5 impact evaluation studies, or a total of 12 to 15 studies distributed over the five regional departments. By the end of the proposed TA, impact evaluation will have been mainstreamed in ADB operations, i.e., it is envisioned that impact evaluation is incorporated in the design of ADB s investment projects, especially in project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) projects.Sub-projectsEach subproject will include 4 to 5 impact evaluation studies and will comprise two main components, namely, (a) the conduct of IE studies applying various methodologies and survey instruments, and (b) the development of impact evaluation methodologies, approaches, and capacities in both ADB and the DMCs.(a) Conduct of IE studiesThe IE studies component will cover support to conduct of a number of IE studies while ensuring that at least one study will be supported in each of the five regions (Central and West Asia, East Asia, the Pacific, South Asia, and Southeast Asia). Activities under the individual studies may include design of the study methodology and survey instruments; conduct of baseline, mid-line and end-line surveys; and production of the study reports. The proposed TA will endeavor to support the conduct of full IE studies from beginning to end within the timeframe of the proposed TA. However, as learned from the experience of TA 7680, the TA may support key phases of individual studies; for example, as to be approved by the IE Committee, only the design and conduct of the baseline survey may be implemented under the proposed TA, while the mid-line and end-line surveys can be financed through separate initiatives. Through this component, the TA will provide direct technical support by individual and firm consultants, and ERD specialists to individual studies by advising on study design, methodology, and application in all phases of the study. This technical support will also include partnerships with renowned IE research institutes (e.g., International Initiative for Impact Evaluation or the Jameel Lateef Poverty Action Lab) to provide expertise, as well as ground-level support for DMCs in the design of IE frameworks and methodologies (e.g., visits to project sites, pre-testing of survey instruments, and other fieldwork activities).(b) Development of impact evaluation methodologies, approaches, and capacitiesThe second component on development of IE-methodologies, approaches and capacities will entail a number of activities including (i) review of IE methodologies and adoption of available techniques and tools for sector and theme specific studies; (ii) conduct of pilot studies to test sector- or theme-specific techniques and tools; (iii) IE awareness raising and capacity building for DMC officials and project staff; (iv) establishment of a central IE data source containing information on project baseline, mid-line and end-line surveys (e.g., questionnaires, sampling methodology, interviewer manuals, field data, etc.); and (v) conduct of knowledge-sharing activities (i.e., regional conferences, where IE studies conducted will be presented; workshops and seminars, where experts will be invited to share methods, practices and lessons on IE) and dissemination of IE studies (publishing IE studies for distribution to ADB and government counterparts, and uploading studies in the ADB website).",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/46185-002/main,25 Feb 2013,1500000.0,0,2013,Public sector management,No

Viet Nam,South East Asia,Integrated Rural Development Sector Project in the Central Province - Additional Financing,"The proposed S-PPTA is needed in order to ensure due diligence is undertaken for the additional financing, especially technical and economic aspects, safeguards and social development. It will also include the incorporation of the additional project costs into the overall project financing plan and a revision of project documents to include the expanded project scope. It is expected that, if additional financing becomes available, implementation procedures for the additional subprojects will follow current implementation procedures. For investments that may be considered, 39 subprojects have already been screened, determined to be eligible, and prioritized on a provincial basis. Moreover, draft project documents for additional financing including a draft RRP and PAM have already been prepared. However, since the original project was approved in 2007, a new safeguard policy has been instituted within ADB. Thus it is necessary to update the safeguard procedures and documents to conform to this policy. It is also proposed to fully review one of the subprojects based on the new policy so that a model is available for the remaining subprojects to be prepared and financed during the period of additional loan implementation. Furthermore, since gender issues and other social issues are closely aligned with safeguard issues, a revised gender action plan will be prepared and undertaken for the sample subproject. On the basis of this experience, the safeguard and social documents will be updated. The selected subproject will also be subjected to due diligence on its technical, economic, financial and governance aspectsIn addition, it will be necessary to allocate the additional funding among funding categories (civil works, consulting services, project management, capacity building, etc.) based on experiences in implementing the original project and to adjust project documentation accordingly. A re-costing of the Project will thus be necessary, and revisions to the existing draft project documents, primarily the PAM and the RRP will also be required.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/37097-043/main,05 Feb 2013,200000.0,0,2013,"Agriculture, natural resources and rural development",Yes

Bangladesh,South Asia,Improving Public Administration and Services Delivery through e-Solutions,"The proposed TA aims to improve public administrations and public service deliveries using e-Solutions leading to inclusive development. The outcome of theproposed TA is envisaged the successful introduction of e-Services for selected governments and target districts.The proposed project is consistent with ADB's country partnership strategy. It supports the recommendations in ADB's 2009 country assistance program evaluation for Bangladesh, which found that lack of good governance in many areas is one of the country's binding constraints on growth, and recommended support for further governance reforms. Hence, the ADB's country operations business plan for 2010 2012 for Bangladesh focuses on providing assistance in this area. Recognizing the need for the application of ICT tools for improved governance, the proposed TA has identified key areas where the application of ICT tools has the potential to enhance efficiency, transparency, and accountability in public service delivery.The proposed project is basically in line with the USD25mil ADB loan project which has begun effective in Oct. 2011 for three years with the aim of improved transparency and accountability in tax and land record administrations at both the central and local levels in Bangladesh. Furthermore, the proposed project has following features: It will look for broader opportunities in government functions that would significantly affect governance reforms in Bangladesh. It will support the Governance Management Project from the e-Governance perspective to maximize investment in ICT in line with the Government's Digital Bangladesh strategy. More specifically, the proposed project will support the Government plan to introduce e-Governance at all executive levels of the Government linking all local government institutions by 2015. The propose project is unique from the traditional ADB projects in that it tries to fill the gap between the Government's new initiative to emphasize ICT for multi-sectors and what ADB used to support under the ADB's public sector management. E-Governance has both features of ICT as well as public sector management. Since ICT applications have lots of common functions that can be applied to any e-Governance project including ICT infrastructure, it would be much more effective and efficient if those common functions are designed, delivered and managed in integrated and consolidated fashion, which is normally not happened in ADB's traditional operation where ICT has not been systematically incorporated to date.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/46476-001/main,24 Oct 2013,700000.0,0,2013,Information and communication technology,Yes

Regional,Regional,Developing Procurement Capacity for Improved Procurement Outcomes,"Public procurement is increasingly being recognized as a tool to improve public service delivery and broader development outcomes. ADB and other development partners have supported DMCs (developing member countries) to improve their public procurement systems for the last 10-15 years. However, inefficient use of funds, continuing delays in project implementation and corruption remain a major concern to governments and development partners alike. Through the Paris Declaration, Accra Agenda for Action and Busan Declaration, ADB has committed to increasingly rely on country systems and support to procurement capacities in DMCs. Efforts to reform DMCs public procurement have primarily focused on reforms at the national level (e.g. legal and regulatory framework) and individual staff skill enhancement (training government officials engaged in procurement). Although many projects supporting procurement reforms have met their intended targets, a huge task remains to translate these national level procurement reforms into actual changes in procurement practices and improvements in procurement outcomes .The R-CDTA will promote a new approach focusing on selected ministries/local governments (procuring entities - PEs) and other key participants in the procurement process in key sectors. The PEs will be identified in cooperation with the national public procurement authorities and regional departments. A partnership approach with the PEs will be implemented to improve the procurement operations of the PE. If weaknesses prohibiting efficient procurement management are found outside the realm of PE, the R-CDTA may support initiatives addressing these weaknesses, whether they are institutional or organizational (e.g. national procurement regulatory agencies, supreme audit institutions (SAIs), private sector or other stakeholders). The approach recognizes that procurement capacity development is a long-term effort and must build on PE ownership and be tailored to the specific circumstances. The focus on individual PEs will allow innovative and focused interventions that can yield results without major legal or institutional reforms being necessary. The lessons learned and results achieved can be replicated in other PEs.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/46227-001/main,12 Dec 2012,1500000.0,0,2012,Public sector management,No

India,South Asia,Chhattisgarh State Road Sector Project,"Chhattisgarh Public Works Department (CGPWD) in 2002-2003, prepared a 10-Year Master Plan for Road Sector Development (MPRSD) for the years 2003 to 2012. MPRSD is based on social and economic development needs, development priorities for the road sector, and alternative investment strategies to support social and economic development priorities. It aims to (i) promote development of six main road corridors, (ii) remove capacity bottlenecks from the network to better connect rural areas, and (iii) support socio-economic development by improving road access and connectivity among growth centers. Based on MPRSD, Government of Chhattisgarh prepared and approved a priority investment program to improve about 5,000km of state roads at an estimated cost of about Rs105 billion ($2 billion). In order to support this plan, Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided a loan of $180 million from its ordinary capital resources in 2003, which supported improvement of about 1,249km of state roads in Chhattisgarh as well as state roads sector reforms and the project was completed in July 2011. Considering the substantial improvement of implementing capacity of CGPWD and in order to continuously support the road sector development in Chhattisgarh, the second loan of state roads project was proposed and included in the India country operations business plan (COBP) 2012-2014 for $300 million allocation from the ordinary capital resources.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/44427-013/main,05 Jun 2014,246950000.0,0,2014,Transport,No

Pakistan,Central and West Asia,Capacity Building for Enhanced Safeguards Management,"Combination of weak systems and absence of a regulatory framework governing involuntary resettlement pose a major challenge to safeguards compliance in ADB-financed projects in the country. The TA will focus on improving institutional safeguards management to effectively address internal capacity constraints, and providing legal advice, interpretation and recommendations on applicable national and provincial laws to address resettlement related issues in two key federal agencies, the National Highway Authority (NHA) and the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA), responsible for transport, and water and power development, respectively. NHA and WAPDA will be the EAs for the TA. Each agency should appoint a qualified Director, Resettlement prior to start of TA implementation.NHA: NHA established the Environment Afforestation Land and Social Unit (EALS) 2007, at the headquarters in Islamabad. However to date, NHA has not recruited a resettlement specialist to undertake even a minimal level of quality supervision. Staff resources in the environment section are better with a director, environment and 3 staff members in place. However, four regional assistant director positions for environment remain vacant. Similar positions for responding to social safeguards are not available. The focus of the unit is on expeditious land acquisition and not on mitigating adverse social impacts. NHA has a total of 52 ongoing projects across Pakistan. There is no effective management information system (MIS) for tracking safeguards. The staff resources in EALS are insufficient and not skilled to manage both domestically and externally financed projects. Staff designated to work on resettlement are legal experts with exposure and training on safeguards obtained by working on externally financed projects. Safeguards preparation is outsourced to large engineering firms with limited safeguards capacity. The combined effect of NHA's weak capacity and outsourcing to engineering firms results in poor compliance both at preparation and implementation. At the field level, resettlement is managed by land management staff with no skilled personnel assigned for resettlement management. Institutional support is necessary if NHA is to respond effectively to social safeguards issues. WAPDA: WAPDA is the key federal agency responsible for developing multipurpose water resources projects. After the Ghazi Barotha project completed in 2002, no new hydropower projects have been built except for raising Mangla dam. The Tarbela project (officially completed in 1976 with funding from the WB) is still _plagued_ by unsettled land compensation and uncertainty about numbers of displaced households. Pakistan faces a critical situation with regard to water storage and energy. Under WAPDA's vision 2025, 8 priority projects for major dams at an estimated cost of $28.7 billion are identified. The report also points out that there is _much confusion_ in Pakistan about benefit sharing. Essentially, paying special attention to those who _pay the price_ in terms of giving up their lands and are resettled. Large scale projects typically entail the resettlement of several thousand households. In 2010, WAPDA established a Land Acquisition and Resettlement Unit (LARU). The unit has had a high staff turnover. WAPDA Environment Cell (WEC) was established in 1987 however it is not adequately integrated into the business operations. The principal challenge for WAPDA in undertaking major resettlement programs is the limited pool of expertise and experienced specialists in the LARU and in Pakistan in general. Even with experienced experts, large resettlement programs require several full-time experts to be fully engaged in preparation and supervision of implementation. Capacity and systems for internal monitoring of large scale resettlement and environment performance are yet to be developed. The model for project development requires a shift in thinking, where design, civil works and safeguards should be effectively coordinated and projects designed to be environmentally and socially sound. Provincial revenue department staff and staff from engineering and management of the two agencies will be included in key TA activities. A degree of institutional restructuring will be required to ensure environment and social safeguards units are effectively incorporated into each agencies structure. Further, tools for safeguards screening will be prepared to ensure a structured and uniform process for safeguards management in each agency. Both agencies will be supported to develop a policy framework for managing resettlement to be approved by the respective Boards. Often, field level staff engaged in day-to-day land acquisition and resettlement activities are unable to participate in training workshops due to budget limitations and/or time availability. The standard approach of seminars and workshops is insufficient to address the detail of safeguards planning; coordination with multiple agencies will be supported leading to the development of procedures for interaction with key stakeholders. The proposed TA will carry out key institutional improvements and policy development at the agency level accompanied by establishing an integrated approach to project development and safeguards management. The TA approach is to work directly with the NHA and WAPDA and jointly develop work plans to ensure ownership and commitment for the expected changes resulting from the TA.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/46428-001/main,11 Feb 2013,550000.0,0,2013,Energy,No

Myanmar,South East Asia,Capacity Building Support for Project Identification,"The TA is designed to support key sector ministries to outline a methodology for prioritizing selection of potential projects, identify feasible investment projects, and initiate the preparation of pre-feasibility analysis of pilot projects in these sectors to improve their capacities using practical tools and methodologies. The sectors included in the TA have been selected according to government priorities and the potential for ADB support, based on preliminary needs assessments, strategies, and road maps. ADB sector teams had discussions with participating ministries from April to September 2012 to agree on the scope of the TA. This TA complements another capacity development TA, which provides advisors and training for government officials to identify sector needs and improve policies and institutional development in key ministries. The government has instituted wide-ranging reforms as part of the ongoing economic, social, and political transformation. Major initiatives include the unification of the exchange rate, a new investment law, monetary and financial sector reforms, and changes to the trade union law. The government has also initiated the process to identify and address policy and institutional issues at the sector level, with the support of ADB and other development partners. These reforms are essential in establishing a sound macroeconomic national policy framework and developing efficient institutions and policies. However, they are not sufficient to ensure the achievement of Myanmar's development objectives. There is a need to simultaneously improve the capacities of government officials and ministries to develop methodologies and practical tools that allow them to identify and prepare viable investment projects. Macroeconomic and sector-specific reforms need to be implemented in parallel with viable investment projects that provide tangible benefits to the population. Projects must be identified, prepared, and implemented using efficient methodologies and mechanisms that respect environmental and social concerns, maximize economic benefits, and ensure financial sustainability.Among the sectors that are expected to play a strategic role in Myanmar's development, this TA will focus on transport, energy, agriculture and natural resources, and water supply and other municipal infrastructures and services. These sectors have been identified based on the expressed priorities of the government and the results of the preliminary assessments, strategies, and road maps conducted by ADB staff. The government is making great efforts to improve performance in these areas and to address many issues confronting these sectors, including (i) improving organizational structures, (ii) clarifying institutional responsibilities among and within sector agencies, (iii) developing long-range strategic sector planning to prioritize public investments, (iv) updating policies and regulations, and (v) improving capacity for performing policy and regulatory functions. However, all these reforms will have to be accompanied by specific investment projects that deliver concrete results. After years of isolation, sector ministries have limited experience in project identification, design, implementation, and evaluation. This has resulted in insufficient provision of infrastructure and low levels of access to services. There is an urgent need to assist line ministries in the identification of viable projects and to improve their capacities for the preparation of pre-feasibility studies for investment projects, which will use modern appraisal techniques, including economic and financial analyses, efficient procurement systems, environmental analysis, and other safeguard measures. Specific issues for each of the four priority sectors identified are described below.Transport. The government has constructed a highway to link Yangon, Nay Pyi Taw, and Mandalay and has built many bridges in the country. However, Myanmar's transport sector is underdeveloped for a country of its size, population, and potential. It is characterized by high transport costs and the absence of a sufficiently extensive lower level road network, restricting the access of much of the population to economic and social opportunities. The government is working to improve core sector issues, including (i) consolidating fragmented and overlapping institutional structures for managing development of the sector; (ii) developing an overall transport sector strategy; (iii) improving capacity in sector agencies; and (iv) increasing the role of the private sector. A key issue that requires urgent support is the development of a more rigorous approach to select transport infrastructure investments and to prepare and implement road projects, using modern and efficient techniques. Capacity development support is also required to mitigate the potential adverse environmental and social impacts of the transport development through increased movement of people and goods, including the prevention of HIV.Energy. Despite abundant energy resources and recent efforts by the government to develop energy resources, Myanmar has one of the lowest levels of energy consumption in Southeast Asia because of its low per capita income and inadequate energy infrastructure. The electrification ratio is low (26%) and system losses are high (27%). Persistent power supply shortages exist in Yangon and Mandalay; and existing power generation, transmission and distribution, and gas pipeline networks are inefficient and poorly maintained. The government intends to look at options to improve its fragmented institutional structure, which results in weak coordination and planning (e.g., there are no long-term energy supply and demand projections). However, other important sector issues include (i) difficulty in generation and transmission planning and operation and maintenance caused by the absence of electric performance standards and a unified power grid code; (ii) weak experience in preparing feasible projects; and (iii) outmoded and inefficient legal safeguard requirements.Water supply and other municipal infrastructure and services. The rate of urbanization in Myanmar is relatively small compared to many other members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), with urban development being dominated by Yangon and Mandalay. The government has recognized the need to develop (i) a coherent framework to harness private sector participation in urban development programs, projects, and activities; (ii) adequate policy and strategic guidance at the central and local levels; and (iii) clear institutional roles and responsibilities for planning, management, and regulation. However, chronic underinvestment in urban infrastructure, particularly in water supply and sanitation, has resulted in the lack of and/or poor quality of services, which can only improve if the policy and institutional reforms initiated by the government are accompanied by the identification and preparation of viable investment projects.Agriculture and natural resources. The government has implemented reforms since 2002 to increase private sector participation and productivity in the agriculture sector and has built several dams to manage water resources. However, the full potential of agriculture for contributing to economic growth and poverty reduction has not been realized, despite its dominant role in Myanmar's economy. Physical constraints (lack of access to markets and inputs, inadequate access to irrigation facilities, and substantial deficiency in the provision of electricity to rural areas) and policy-related factors (unattractive producer prices, high cost of farm inputs such as fertilizer, lack of access to credit, outmoded land tenure system, and poorly developed research and extension system) have obstructed agricultural development in Myanmar.

People's Republic of China,East Asia,Hunan Xiangjiang Inland Waterway Transport Project,"Hunan is a land-locked province located in central PRC. It has a population of 68.4 million. It is one of the six central provinces supported by Government's Central Region Development Strategy. Hunan is rich in navigable waterway resources. It has the third longest provincial IWT network in the PRC, with over 11,495 km of waterways, 107 ports and 1,880 berths. However, only 5% of the waterway and berths can accommodate vessels of up to 1,000 tons carrying capacity. Historically, IWT used to be the most important transport mode in the province. By 2009 it was carrying 10% of total freight ton-km, reflecting past low public investment in IWT compared to other modes. In 2009 the total IWT investment was CNY551 million, about 1% of total road investment.The Xiang River (Xiangjiang) is one of the largest tributaries of the Yangtze and the largest river in the province. Originating in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, it is 969 km long, with 773 km in Hunan before it flows into the Yangtze River (Map). The Xiang waterway network runs from south to north, via the Yangtze River, connecting six of Hunan's cities and major concentrations of population with the PRC's east coast seaports. Habitation and industry in Hunan is oriented along the river valleys. There is a great potential for further development of Xiang waterway to support transport of minerals and agricultural products from their sources inland to the major markets on the eastern seaboard, including by inland shipping services linking the Yangtze and Xiang rivers.With the encouragement from the MOT's vessel standardization programs, the average vessel capacity in Hunan has increased from 213 deadweight tons (dwt) in 2005 to 318 dwt in 2010. The largest vessel in operation at present is 5,600 dwt. Traffic on the Xiang waterway has grown at 21% per annum since 2000. However, these increases in vessel size and traffic have taken place in the downstream part of Xiang River and the areas close to the Yangtze River. The middle and upper reaches currently have limited water depth and long rocky shoals prevent safe year-round access by large vessels. Further growth is also constrained by obsolete and insufficient port infrastructure and landing facilities. These bottlenecks restrict the utilization of the middle and upper streams of the Xiang River, and increase the transport cost and voyage time, which reduce the competiveness of the waterway compared with other modes of transport. Removal of these bottlenecks is a priority.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/43031-013/main,25 Apr 2013,148810000.0,0,2013,Transport,No

Moreover, at the end of the TA, lessons on how ADB reports/publications helped DMC governments compose policy response to emerging needs and challenges can be drawn and be used as reference for on-going and succeeding TAs. 10. This TA will comprise three major outputs with corresponding activities as follows:a) Macroeconomic surveillance work and analysis: In order to enhance the macroeconomic surveillance of South Asian countries, an Economic Update (EU) report will be published bi-annually for Bhutan Maldives and Nepal . Given data for some of the South Asian countries are scant, patchy and not available on commercial databases, this TA aims to keep policy makers and ADB staff well informed of the economic developments within the region by providing consolidated report on the most recent key macroeconomic data and economic updates of these specific economies. The TA will provide a venue for analysis of higher-frequency data (e.g., inflation, foreign exchange reserves, balance of payments, etc.) that are essential in policy making. Through the EU, the TA also seeks to act as an economic guide post, especially during turbulent times, to assist policy makers and other stakeholders in formulating mitigating policy measures when necessary. The EU will be produced through a concerted effort among SARD focal points and the TA team, with the latter as the coordinating body. The EU will be disseminated widely among policy makers, ADB staff, and other key stakeholders in the region. Also this component has a capacity building element which intends to strengthen the capabilities of the above selected South Asian DMC governments on macroeconomic surveillance through workshops and seminars.b) Review of major development challenges: This component will see publication of at least two flagship knowledge products on themes of significance for the region . Potential themes include, among others, urbanization, jobs and skills, inflation, energy, etc. The selection of which themes rigorously analyzed will be done by the project steering committee in consultations with DMC governments. Experts will be mobilized to undertake analytical work on the selected topics and an inception as well as consultation workshop will be organized to facilitate discussion on each topic. A dissemination workshop will also be undertaken for each flagship publication where key stakeholders - including representatives of government ministries and agencies, development partners, the private sector, civil society, and academic and research institution - will be invited.c) Economic policy advice: With deeper integration of South Asian countries into the global economy and robust economic growth, the governments are confronted with new challenges that require diagnosis and solutions in a timely fashion. This component will provide standby research support for policy needs that require immediate redress (e.g., the recent Rupee liquidity crunch in Bhutan, food crisis that may unfold in the region, and the like). Upon the demand/request of the DMC governments, the policy advice component of the TA will conduct assessments and analytical work on development issues faced by DMCs, which will assist in formulating policy measures to address the issues.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/46214-001/main,04 Dec 2012,5000000.0,0,2012,"Agriculture, natural resources and rural development",No
Regional,Regional,Supporting Regional Project Development for Association of Southeast Asian Nations Connectivity,"The members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are committed toward regional economic integration through the realization of an ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) in 2015. To do so, the ASEAN leaders agreed and endorsed in 2010 the Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity (MPAC) to promote infrastructure development and connectivity. With increasing intraregional trade and investment flows, the infrastructure stock in the region needs to keep pace. To better connect the regional market of 600 million people spread across ten different countries, an infrastructure development driven connectivity is key. In addition, regional and subregional sector analyses have confirmed the continued importance of economic corridor connectivity in the drive to realize the AEC.The ASEAN and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) have been collaborating on various initiatives to support the implementation of MPAC. Among these initiatives is the ASEAN Infrastructure Fund (AIF) to provide financing for key infrastructure projects on connectivity. Given the high overall financing requirements (estimated to be around $60 billion per year for ASEAN) and the limited supply of financing, projects need to be prioritized based on their expected impact and viability. Even with the AIF, additional support is needed to ensure that priority projects are properly screened prior to their preparation to maximize their chances of securing private sector participation. While the MPAC has defined priority project concepts to foster connectivity, there is a need to develop a viable project pipeline and to screen projects to ascertain whether they could be financed by such new initiatives as the AIF or by private investments through the PPP modality.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/46309-001/main,04 Dec 2012,1500000.0,0,2012,Finance,No

Sri Lanka,South Asia,Human Capital Development Capacity and Implementation Support,"The development of human capital is critical and a key priority for positioning Sri Lanka as a competitive economy and society based on knowledge and innovation. It sees inclusive and equitable growth possible if based on strong education, skills development and research. During the country programming discussions held during May-August 2012, and special consultation missions for human development, the government indicated that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) should support a coordinated effort to improve planning and implementation of various human development programs in the education sector. Accordingly, a proposed Multitranche Financing Facility for Human Capital Development Investment Program (MFF HCDIP) is being prepared to increase human capital and by enhancing employability of school leavers and graduates and strengthening research and innovation for productivity. To support and strengthen country capacity to implement this long term investment, this $1.5 million capacity development technical assistance (CDTA) for Human Capital Development Capacity and Implementation Support was included in the 2012 non-lending program for Sri Lanka. The proposed CDTA aims to improve results-oriented planning based on medium term expenditure frameworks which would lead to increased and rational investments in human development in Sri Lanka. While this long term approach will enable ADB to support and strengthen policy frameworks pivoted on sound strategic context and backed by government financing, it also challenges the capacity of the various implementing agencies to develop, plan, implement and systemically monitor their medium term sector (expenditure) frameworks and result achievements; and tests the capacity of country systems for public financial management and procurement.

Myanmar,South East Asia,Capacity Development and Institutional Support,"The TA is designed to strengthen the capacity of the government to develop and implement policies through a combination of policy advice, learning programs, workshops and seminars, and exposure to experiences from neighbor countries that faced similar challenges. Given that the capacity constraints are overwhelming and resources limited, the proposed TA will be selective in its interventions. It will improve the capacity of civil servants in government ministries and related public companies, although support to divisions and states could also be considered. The sectors to be included in the TA have been selected according to government priorities and the potential for ADB support based on preliminary needs assessments, strategies, and road maps.The new government is implementing a broad set of reforms as it embarks on a remarkable transition to build an economy that will benefit all citizens. Some major ongoing initiatives concern exchange rate unification, reform of land and investment laws, amendment to the Central Bank Act, finance sector reforms, and reform of the trade union law. These reforms offer a unique opportunity for the country to lay the foundations for a brighter and more prosperous future for its people. The political and economic developments since early 2011 open unprecedented opportunities for Myanmar to catch up with its neighbors and increase its per capita gross domestic product, one of the lowest in Southeast Asia at about $860; reduce the poverty rate from the current 26% to 16% of the country's 60 million people; and improve human development indicators (Myanmar is near the bottom of the list at 149 out of 187 countries). The changes and speed of reform have been impressive, but the challenges are complex and numerous.The country is facing several binding development constraints, including (i) a weak economic policy framework and environment that needs urgent reforms to maintain macroeconomic stability, strengthen public finance, promote private-sector-led trade and investment, and provide timely and reliable statistics to inform policy decisions; (ii) limited capacity of government civil servants for formulating and managing the policy and institutional reform process, coordinating among themselves, and managing external assistance; (iii) weak public institutions that have difficulties to effectively support the economic reform process, efficiently provide essential public services, and develop and enforce strategies, plans, laws, rules, regulations and standards; and (iv) lack of efficient physical infrastructure to support trade and investment in agriculture, manufacturing, and industry, as well as to provide a sufficient level of services to both the urban and rural populations. The country needs to embark on a comprehensive and well-sequenced program of reforms if it is to realize its potential. The regulatory, legal, and policy environment needs upgrading to facilitate the participation of the private sector, promote investment, and diversify the economy. The government needs to develop strategies, investment plans and incentives, and generate adequate fiscal resources to expand access to electricity, water supply and sanitation, and transport, as well as to improve health, education, and social protection systems. Agriculture, which employs about 70% of the population, has great potential for improvement, but is in great need of land reform, expansion of credit to farmers, more public investment in rural infrastructure, and better seeds, fertilizers, extension services, and post-harvest facilities.The capacity of existing socioeconomic policymaking institutions in Myanmar is limited and needs to be bolstered if appropriate economic policy reforms are to be designed and implemented successfully. Strengthening these institutions and giving them more independence in decision making in their areas of responsibility would increase accountability and contribute to better governance and greater transparency and efficiency. The Myanmar civil service has a critical role to play in this reform process. However, the majority of the civil servants have limited exposure to modern public sector management and good governance practices. They have had very few opportunities to develop new techniques and skills, to learn lessons from other countries, or to access high-quality policy advice. To avoid duplication and overstretching of the government's absorptive capacity, the TA will be implemented in consultation with other development agencies that are providing related assistance to the government. The TA takes into account lessons learned from other capacity-building TA projects, especially the need for strong government ownership for TA to be successful and sustainable. The TA also builds on and complements other capacity-building TA projects. In particular, it will harness the experience developed under the ADB-financed GMS Phnom Penh Plan for Development Management, The Phnom Penh Plan builds capacity of civil servants for leadership, public policy, and development management; and promotes regional cooperation in the countries of the GMS. which since 2005 has provided limited support to improve the capacity of civil servants through learning programs outside Myanmar.Policy advisors will support selected government agencies in preparing the new policy agenda, in line with the government strategy to reduce poverty and promote sustainable economic growth. Advisors placed in key ministries will work closely with government officials to assist them in the preparation of policy papers, plans, strategies, laws, or regulations. They will also suggest improvements to management systems, policies, and procedures in the ministries through the preparation of institutional development plans. These will be complemented by the preparation of capacity-building plans based on training needs assessments, in-country training programs based on demand, and out-of-country programs to learn lessons and best practices from neighbor countries. The TA will also support workshops, seminars, and conferences to share knowledge and discuss economic development and policy issues.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/46254-001/main,05 Feb 2013,2090000.0,0,2013,"Agriculture, natural resources and rural development",No

Bhutan,South Asia,Enhancing Development Management for Sustainable and Inclusive Growth,"The main objective of the government's Tenth Five Year Plan (2008-2013) is poverty reduction with an aim to reduce the poverty rate to less than 15% by 2013. The government also aims to achieve an average annual GDP growth rate of 9% during the plan period. Closely aligned with the Tenth Five Year Plan, the overarching goal of ADB's forthcoming interim Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2012-2013 for Bhutan will be poverty reduction through economic diversification, which has been adopted from the previous CPS 2006-2010. In order to sustain a high economic growth in a dynamic macroeconomic context, there is a growing need for strengthening the capacity of the government to guide, monitor, and evaluate the development process, identify the need for remedial measures, and take responsive actions to address the issues as noted in Bhutan Vision 2020.Given that one of the key strategic thrusts of the interim CPS is to provide support for capacity development in the overall management of the development process, the proposed technical assistance (TA) is relevant and responsive to the strategic objective of the Tenth Five Year Plan as well as the interim CPS. The proposed TA is also a direct response to the request made by the government for ADB's support for strengthening the operational capacity of MOF. The proposed TA will build on ADB's ongoing assistance for undertaking the 2012 Third Bhutan Living Standards Survey. The socio-economic assessment and impact evaluation studies proposed under the TA using the household survey data will be highly relevant and useful for guiding the design of future interventions by the government, ADB, and development partners and enhancing their continuous efforts in further reducing poverty in Bhutan.The TA will have the following two outputs: Output 1: Strengthened analytical skills in macroeconomic management and project implementation. Under this output, in-country training, seminars and/or workshops will be organized for MOF staff to enhance their economic management capacity. In-country training workshops on project implementation-related issues, including procurement, disbursement and safeguards, will also be organized for officials from MOF and other key government ministries. In addition, a field trip(s) will be conducted for exchange of best practices and knowledge sharing with other Developing Member Countries. The exact topics of the activities will be demand driven and determined in consultation with MOF. Policy advice will also be provided when and as requested by MOF to support them to address emerging issues in a timely manner. The policy advice provided under this output will be published as an analytical report and/or policy briefs for wider dissemination.Output 2: Enhanced knowledge on socio-economic assessment and impact evaluation studies. This output will generate various knowledge products based on data from the Third Bhutan Living Standards Survey, including socio-economic assessment and impact evaluation studies, which will assist the government and other key stakeholders in fine tuning their policies and operations. The output will also include analytical work that will directly contribute to the body of knowledge being established for the new economic paradigm that has been the government's recent initiative (i.e., measuring and achieving wellbeing and happiness, fair distribution, efficient use of resources, among others). Inception and consultation workshops will be organized to ensure that the consultative approach will be undertaken in the conduct of the studies. Study reports as well as various policy briefs will be produced. Under this output, in-country training will also be organized to enhance the analytical capacity of officials from key government ministries and agencies, which will help them formulate more evidence-based policies.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/46189-001/main,11 Jan 2013,1475000.0,0,2013,Public sector management,Yes

Subprogram 1, implemented in 2007 2008, included a policy-based grant, a project grant supporting the development of information technology systems for effective implementation of reforms, and a TA grant to help prepare subprogram 2. Preparation and implementation of subprogram 2 has also benefited from and reinforced other interventions. The reforms supported under subprogram 2 build on the achievements made under subprogram 1 despite difficult political and external conditions. They address binding constraints to private sector development and diversification in the areas of business regulation and taxation, access to finance, worker skills development, and public private partnerships (PPPs). The relevance of these constraints has been confirmed through recent studies and surveys, which explain some deviations from the constraints originally identified in 2008. Subprogram 2 is effectively gender mainstreamed to maximize benefits to women. The reform agenda that remains after subprogram 2 will be addressed under subprogram 3. Subprogram 2 complements the efforts of (i) ADB and other development partners to strengthen physical infrastructure and improve access to finance; and (ii) the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to rebuild fiscal buffers and safeguard monetary stability, which are important for a healthy business and investment climate. Improving the investment climate for the private sector is critical for the government's economic growth policies. Subprogram 2 contributes toward this end.

Advisors from the Pacific Economic Management (PEM) , and Private Sector Development Initiative (PSDI) regional TA projects, as well as from the IMF's Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Center (PFTAC) will also help the government to accomplish the policy actions contained in the program (and highlighted in Table 2, below). The SPFMP builds on lessons and outcomes of the Improved Financial Management Program (IFMP), which was ADB's first budget support operation in Tuvalu (albeit a programmatic budget support operation with multiple tranches). This program was aimed at strengthening the governance framework for Tuvalu's public enterprises, improving the government's capacity for oversight, strengthening capacity to manage debt, and reducing the government's debt to the National Bank of Tuvalu (NBT). The IFMP was instrumental in helping the government to implement several substantive reform actions including:-improved debt management capability via the approval of a debt risk management and mitigation policy and strategy;-strengthened oversight of public enterprises via approval of a public enterprise governance reform strategic policy and the enactment of the Public Enterprise (Performance and Accountability) Act 2009; and-strengthened management capacity in public enterprises via approval of an asset/liability management (liquidity) policy and a loan grading policy for NBT that allows timely collection of past due loans and advances of credit, and measuring, monitoring and maintaining adequate liquidity. The Banking Commission Act 2011, which provided the legal framework for the licensing and on-going supervision and regulation of banking institutions in Tuvalu based on the Basel core principles for effective banking supervision, was also approved by Parliament in 2011.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/45395-001/main,11 Feb 2013,2350000.0,0,2013,Public sector management,No

Regional,Regional,Joint Control of Transboundary Animal Diseases in the People’s Republic of China and Mongolia,"1. The technical assistance (TA) is designed at the request of the governments of the PRC and Mongolia to assist in formulating policy recommendations for establishment of a subregional mechanism for joint prevention and control of transboundary animal diseases(TADs) in Northeast Asia and conduct of priority capacity building programs. Where necessary and appropriate, the TA will encourage and support the participation of other parties concerned in Northeast Asia, particularly in the area of information exchange and knowledge sharing. 2. The PRC and Mongolia face a common threat posed by TADs, in particular foot and mouth disease, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (also known as blue-ear pig disease), and highly pathogenic avian influenza. The two countries share a border stretching 4,700 kilometers. Animal husbandry plays an important role in the economic development of border provinces of both countries and is vulnerable to TADs. Recurrent outbreaks in domestic and wild animals have caused tremendous harm to animal health and safety. They also pose serious threats to human health and may cause huge economic losses. The International Federation for Animal Health reported that an outbreak of foot and mouth disease from November 2010 to April 2011 in the PRC, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Mongolia required the culling of 3.5 million animals and an emergency vaccination program, inflicting losses of $2.8 billion. 3. Animal diseases incur costs in terms of (i) lost production, which disproportionally affects herders and farmers in rural and border areas who are often economically vulnerable; (ii) resources needed to monitor and control outbreaks; and (iii) harm to human health and welfare. When animal diseases cross borders, as often happens, costs are even higher, and prevention and control become more complex and difficult. In a rapidly globalized economy, TADs can trigger trade restrictions on animal products, especially meat, dairy, and leather goods. Mongolia is vulnerable to such trade restrictions because animal product exports are important revenue sources for the country. 4. The persistence and spread of TADs stem from various factors, including the migration of wild animals, illegal border trade in animal products, and cross-border grazing. The lack of a cross-border and regional mechanism for policy dialogue, information sharing, and joint action worsens the situation. Weak capacity for TAD control particularly in terms of surveillance, data collection and analysis, laboratory testing, and community monitoring and emergency response in rural and border areas is another constraint on TAD prevention and control. In the PRC and Mongolia, as in many other developing countries, veterinary services urgently need bolstering. To prevent the spread of TADs across the borders, countries need to adopt effective measures nationally and through regional cooperation.5. The TA's impact will be strengthened regional cooperation to prevent and control TADs in the PRC, Mongolia, and more broadly in the CAREC region. The outcome will be a well-functioning institutional mechanism for cooperation to jointly prevent and control TADs in the PRC and Mongolia.6. The impact and outcome will be achieved through the following outputs: (i) a study report on establishing a mechanism for PRC-Mongolia cooperation to jointly control major TADs, which will recommend policies and steps toward establishing  such a mechanism and analyze the feasibility of and options for involving other countries and parties in Central Asia; (ii) a manual on community-level TAD prevention and control to guide animal health workers in the border communities of the two countries;  (iii) enhanced capacity for TAD prevention and control in PRC and Mongolian border provinces achieved by preparing a 5-year capacity-development plan and organizing  training workshops; and (iv) policy briefs and/or best practice notes for senior decision makers of the PRC and Mongolia.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/46025-001/main,21 Nov 2012,500000.0,0,2012,"Agriculture, natural resources and rural development",No
Regional,Regional,Supporting the Use of Carbon Financing to Promote Green Growth in Asia and the Pacific,"ADB established the Carbon Market Program (CMP) in 2006 (then called the Carbon Market Initiative) through technical assistance: (i) TA 6363-REG: Preparing Clean Energy Projects Eligible for the Clean Development Mechanism; and (ii) TA 6438-REG: Implementation of the Technical Support Facility. Both TAs were designed to assist low-carbon projects in DMCs benefit from a single regulated carbon market mechanism - the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). The successful implementation of CMP allowed ADB to scale up from less than 10 projects in 2006 to over 100 projects seeking to register as CDM in 2012.The proposed TA aims to build on this success and continue to deliver a one-stop technical support facility to ADB's operational deparments and DMC clients amidst the increasing complexity of carbon market schemes particularly during 2013 and 2017 before a new global framework is in place.The TA will develop practical knowledge and experience in carbon market mechanisms that can inform and support DMCs in the implementation of GHG mitigation projects. The key outputs will include: (i) direct project support and targeted capacity building activities for LDCs and underrepresented countries in CDM; (ii) advisory material, tools and standards to enhance regional cooperation across domestic ETSs and enable stronger linkages in the future including possible integration; and (iii) workshops for cross-sharing of knowledge on the set up and implementation of domestic ETSs.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/46173-001/main,21 Nov 2012,950000.0,0,2012,"Agriculture, natural resources and rural development",Yes

Regional,Regional,Greater Mekong Subregion Phnom Penh Plan for Development Management Phase V,"The Phnom Penh Plan for Development Management (PPP) is a capacity development program that supports knowledge products and services in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). It is a pioneering program to build capacities of civil servants and to promote regional cooperation in the GMS. PPP has received total funding of $10.95 million since its inception in 2003 for the first four phases. It is designed as a continuing project, with each phase building on the experiences and lessons of previous phases.The PPP has had notable achievements. Learning programs provide GMS policy makers and managers with conceptual tools and frameworks on regional integration and leadership, core development sectors, development management and cross-cutting themes. These programs enhance their skills in developing and implementing functional and strategic development interventions. To date, 2,032 GMS civil servants have attended 103 PPP learning programs organized with 28 capacity development partners (within and outside the GMS). The PPP supports fellowships to prestigious universities and institutes. Graduates of these learning programs or the 47 fellows, now constitute the core of development leaders who are making a difference in the GMS. Seven issues of the Journal of Greater Mekong Subregion Development Studies, a multidisciplinary peer-reviewed publication promotes better understanding of GMS development issues have been published. The PPP Research Program has funded 4 multi-country research projects (female labor quality; contract farming; financial services in border areas; and cross-border economic zones) participated by 14 GMS institutions and produced 4 working papers, 4 policy briefs and a journal special issue. The PPP organized 7 GMS Development Dialogues (GDDs) attended by 500 participants from government, civil society, academe, private sector and media to provide a platform for in-depth discussion of subregional issues to enhance policy and decision making capacities. The PPP also supports learning resource centers in Cambodia and Lao PDR with about 10,000 users and organized 18 Leaders Networking for Knowledge (LINK) alumni events with 850 participants. A program management and performance monitoring and evaluation system set up to be more results oriented. A newsletter (Mekong Leaders) published and website established.The TA builds on past experiences and lessons learned from previous phases. Several evaluation were conducted on the PPP including an evaluation study conducted by OED in 2008, the PPP Impact Assessment Study also in 2008 and TA completion reports for the first three phases. The major lessons learned include the need for: (i) selecting learning programs with more sharpened focus and customization that contribute to developing individual civil servants capacities to support GMS cooperation; (ii) better targeting of participants involved in GMS working groups, programs and projects; (iii) follow-up and deepening programs, i.e. one-off programs unlikely to lead to sustainable workplace behavior; (iv) progressively develop technical and financial sustainability; (v) more active roles of GMS institutions (both research and training), despite their weak capacities, for PPP to _phase out_ and eventually assume a more facilitative and enabling role; (vi) developing a pool of GMS trainers and experts; (vii) GMS learning materials (e.g. case studies, manuals and tool kits); (viii) better synergies and linkages of policy research with learning programs; and (ix) better indicators (baseline and targets) for more results-oriented capacity development. These lessons were taken into account, thus the R-CDTA design include new key features: (i) customized regional cooperation learning programs; (ii) better targeting of participants; (iii) sustainability strategies such as Training of Trainers (TOT), learning materials development and new partnership modalities; (iv) South-south cooperation focusing on low income countries; and (v) tracer studies and comprehensive evaluation.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/46232-001/main,19 Nov 2012,750000.0,0,2012,Public sector management,No
Myanmar,South East Asia,Financial Management Assessment of Energy Sector,"The Republic of the Union of Myanmar (Myanmar) is emerging from decades of isolation by instituting major economic, social and political transformation. The country has rich natural resources hydropower (100,000 megawatt); oil (3.2 billion barrels); natural gas (22 trillion cubic feet); and coal (2 billion tons). With abundant natural resources, a long coastline of around 2,800 kilometer, which provides access to sea routes that would facilitate regional trade, it has the potential to serve as a land bridge between PRC, South Asia and Southeast Asia.Despite abundant energy resources and recent efforts by the Government to develop energy resources, Myanmar has one of the lowest levels of energy consumption in Southeast Asia due to its low per capita income and insufficient energy infrastructure. The electrification rate is low at 26% and system losses are high at 27%. There are persistent power supply shortages in Yangon and Mandalay, and existing power generation, transmission, and distribution, and gas pipeline networks are inefficient and poorly maintained. Core sector issues include (i) difficulty in generation and transmission planning and operation and maintenance due to the absence of electric performance standards and unified power grid code; (ii) fragmented institutional structure, resulting in lack of coordination and planning (eg. There are no long-term supply and demand projections); and (iii) outmoded and inefficient legal safeguard requirements. The power sector in Myanmar is governed by the Electricity Act 1948 (as amended in 1967), the Myanmar Electricity Law (1984), and the Electricity Rules (1985). Prior to 7 September 2012, the power sector in Myanmar was under the responsibility of the Ministry of Electric Power No 1 (MOEP1) and the Ministry of Electric Power No 2 (MOEP2). MOEP1 was responsible for developing, implementing, operating and maintaining all large hydropower and coal-fired thermal power plants. MOEP2 was responsible for (i) developing, operating and maintaining the transmission network and distribution systems throughout the country, (ii) operating and maintaining gas-fired thermal power generation, and (iii) planning, constructing and operating mini-hydropower plants.MOEP1 consisted of three departments: Department of Hydropower Planning (DHPP), Department of Hydropower Implementation (DHPI) and Hydropower Generation Enterprise (HPGE). DHPP planned hydropower projects to be implemented. DHPI had four institutes responsible for design, investigation works and mechanical works; and seven engineering construction companies capable of construction and installation of large hydropower projects. HPGE operated and maintained all MOEP1's hydropower stations, and participated in the operation and maintenance of power plants under joint ventures. It also operated a coal-fired power plant.MOEP2 had four department level organizations: the Department of Electric Power (DEP), Myanmar Electric Power Enterprise (MEPE), Yangon Electric Supply Board (YESB), and Electric Supply Enterprise (ESE). DEP's main function was power system strategic planning. MEPE was responsible for the development and implementation of transmission networks and the operation and maintenance of gas-fired power plants. Two distribution enterprises operated the distribution systems. YESB was responsible for the supply of electricity to consumers in Yangon City. ESE covered the rest of the country comprising 27 states and divisions, including off-gird generation and distribution. It was also responsible for planning and implementing and operating off-grid mini hydropower and diesel stations. YESB and ESE also implemented the improvement and expansion of the distribution system.As of 7 September 2012, MOEP1 and MOEP2 were merged into a single Electric Power Ministry (EPM).",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/46442-001/main,19 Nov 2012,160000.0,0,2012,Energy,Yes

Indonesia,South East Asia,Financial Market Development and Integration Program,"The government's medium-term reform priorities focus on the identified development constraints. First, the government seeks, in particular, to foster economic development by strengthening regulatory oversight. This in turn will increase stability and investor confidence. Also, the Capital Market and Nonbank Financial Industry Master (CMNMP) aims to deepen the capital market, expand access to nonbank financing, and broaden the investor base. To attain these objectives and build momentum for capital market development, the CMNMP provides a functional focus on increasing the linkages between the contractual savings subsector, the subsector dealing in funding arrangements that are compliant with Islamic sharia law, and the traditional capital markets. To support these reforms, the government has requested ADB assistance in the form of a policy-based program loan. The program will build on the government's accomplishments under the post-program partnership framework (P3F) of Subprogram 2 of ADB's Capital Market Development Program Cluster. To support these reforms, the government has requested a loan of $300,000,000 from ADB's ordinary capital resources. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB's London interbank offered rate-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft loan agreement. Under output 1, the creation of the Integrated Financial Services Authority (OJK) was authorized in law in 2011 and the agency will be operational by the end of 2012. This initiative will provide for independent, harmonized, and comprehensive regulation and supervision of the financial markets. ADB has been a consistent supporter of this effort since 2002. In addition, Bapepam-LK has further enhanced its supervisory capabilities and those of the successor OJK by processing the revision of three primary financial sector laws on capital markets, insurance, and pensions to include resolution powers over problematic institutions and qualified supervisor immunity. Drafts of all three laws have been completed, socialized and entered into the national legislative agenda. Bapepam-LK has introduced risk-based supervisory practices to the contractual savings subsector and has continued to pursue regional integration initiatives that include the harmonization of standards. As part of these efforts, Bapepam-LK has participated in an initiative to introduce a common set of corporate governance standards in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and has strengthened corporate governance standards in Indonesia in line with this effort. Programs to develop the capacity of the industry and financial regulators have been completed and will continue.Under output 2, the government focused on coordinated, ongoing activities to strengthen the primary and secondary government debt market, including the market for sukok. Specifically, the Directorate General of Debt Management continued to consolidate government debt issuance around recognized benchmarks. To support the secondary market and to strengthen the conduct of monetary policy, Bank Indonesia discontinued issuance of Bank Indonesia bills, which were supplanted by Treasury bills beginning in 2011. Concurrently, Bank Indonesia began implementing monetary policy through open market operations with its own inventory of securities and repos/reverse repos with maturities of 1 week to 6 months. This reform includes measures to increase the proportion of tradable securities within the government's debt stock by beginning a process through which non-tradable bank recapitalization bonds will be converted to tradable status. To improve market efficiency, increase trading volumes, and strengthen risk management, a draft global master repurchase agreement, with applicable annexes, has been completed and will be introduced into Indonesia in 2013. To provide a greater number and variety of instruments to investors, measures were implemented to ease the securities issuance process and to encourage the use of municipal bonds by rationalizing existing regulations and harmonizing them with those governing the issuance of corporate debt. To improve the quality and transparency of financial information, Bapepam-LK has continued to progress towards full convergence with the International Accounting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards. To strengthen investor protections, Bapepam-LK has launched an initiative to create a securities market investor protection fund and has increased participation in the investor area facility to provide investors with the ability to independently self-monitor their investment portfolios. Bapepam-LK has introduced a code of conduct for market intermediaries.Under output 3, Bapepam-LK has simultaneously increased the contractual savings sector's demand for capital market products. Specifically, Bapepam-LK has encouraged participation in retirement planning by easing the rights issuance process, which benefits employee stock ownership plans, and by exempting investment income earned by pension funds from taxation. Bapepam-LK has also provided an enabling environment for the growth of takaful, a form of Islamic insurance, by issuing guidelines on the governance of takaful undertakings. Bapepam-LK has adopted and implemented basic principles and standards of financial soundness for shariah compliant insurance and reinsurance. To strengthen the conventional insurance industry, Bapepam-LK raised the minimum capital standards for insurance and reinsurance companies and has worked with the industry to improve pricing and risk management in the life and nonlife insurance subsectors. This included collaboration to develop updated mortality tables based on Indonesian data as well as minimum tariffs for auto insurance. To broaden the investor base, the government has encouraged the development of the Islamic finance sector by giving it the same tax treatment as conventional finance. Bapepam-LK revised the criteria for giving stocks sharia-compliant status. As a result, the number of sharia-based contracts expanded and the number of shariah-compliant securities increased. Bapepam-LK has strengthened governance in the contractual savings industry and increased investor confidence by strengthening the role of pension fund controllers' committees.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/44252-013/main,18 Dec 2012,300000000.0,0,2012,Finance,No

People's Republic of China,East Asia,Streamlining Legal and Regulatory Framework for Social Assistance,"The PRC Country Partnership Strategy (2011-2015) identifies inclusive growth, i.e. balanced and equitable development, as one of the three pillars in promoting regional economic advancement. Key to achieving inclusive development is to build a social protection system that can provide the vulnerable population with equitable access to basic social services.Various social assistance programs are being implemented in the PRC. The rural five guarantees and the urban minimum subsistence allowance programs support minimum living standards. However, these programs no longer meet current social needs in terms of targeting and the level of benefits. The purpose of this technical assistance (TA) is to provide the Social Law Department, Legislative Affairs Commission, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, with recommendations for strengthening the legal framework to ensure consistency of policies on social services provision, reduce the disparity in implementation schemes, widen the scope of protection and enhance the level of benefits. ADB is supporting a number of technical assistance (TA) projects related to the PRC social protection system, namely: (i) the TA for Building Equitable Opportunities into Social Assistance Project aims to improve social assistance services delivery by ensuring equitable provision of benefits, access to services, and capacities to deliver such services, (ii) the TA for Management System and Legislative Mechanism for Nonprofit Organizations Project focuses on developing a legal framework of nonprofit organizations (NP0s), including charity organizations, industry associations, research institutions and academic societies, (iii) the TA for Policy Study on Strategic Options for Urbanization assists the PRC in developing a national urban development strategy including affordable housing in urban areas, and; (iv) the TA for Performance Evaluation Model for the Urban and Rural Subsistence Social Security, focuses on the implementation effectiveness of social assistance.The proposed TA will build on the experiences and lessons learned from these ongoing ADB initiatives, and focus on the review and recommendations of amendments for the legal framework regulating social assistance programs. It is critical to strengthen the legal framework to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the social assistance provision in the PRC.

People's Republic of China,East Asia,Integrated Strategy for Sustainable Land Management in Dryland Ecosystems,"The existing long-term framework (2002 2012) for the partnership, updated in 2008, supported the national and local governments' pursuit of a sustainable environment and development in drylands. The approach was institutionalized at the provincial level through mainstreaming strategies and an action plan to ensure investment and financial flows for sustainable land management (SLM) and livelihood activities. SLM practices applied in the pilots and investment programs included reforestation, soil erosion control measures, greenhouses for vegetable production, mulching, grazing management, and irrigation control. These practices were implemented alongside rural infrastructure, rural energy, biogas, solar energy, and other development activities that contributed to income generation and improved livelihoods in the pilot sites. These activities were supported by policy actions, legislation, thematic studies, capacity development, and knowledge management. Many technical and institutional aspects of the implementation and management of the partnership require further updating to meet the increasing demand for support and investments at the local levels. The government and partners have identified the following development issues that need to be addressed for the partnership to successfully continue: (i) the need to focus on replication and up-scaling of the achievements of the partnership, with a strong emphasis on investments at the provincial level; (ii) the need to target capacity development and its linkage to demonstration and investment activities; (iii) the need for a broader financial resource mobilization strategy, taking into consideration government, private sector, and development partner resources, as well as innovative mechanisms such as eco-compensation programs; and (iv) the need for the program to have a stronger link with the PRC National Action Plan for the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) and close alignment with the secretariat of the PRC National Committee for implementation of the UNCCD in the State Forestry Administration (SFA).Building on the progress made by the partnership since 2002, the government requested support to prepare a new framework that will guide the implementation of future activities under the partnership. ADB has served as the lead GEF agency for the partnership since 2002 and has provided support for capacity development efforts and the establishment of coordination mechanisms. ADB's comparative advantage as the lead GEF agency for the partnership includes considerable experience with the identification, design, and implementation of TA and investment projects with the PRC as well as the ability to incorporate capacity development and TA into its projects. The government has also committed to allocating $4 million from the land degradation focal area of its GEF-5 resources and commensurate domestic funds to support the management and implementation of the development strategy for SLM for dryland ecosystems.

People's Republic of China,East Asia,Hubei Huanggang Urban Environment Improvement Project,"The proposed project aims to promote environmentally sustainable and socially inclusive urbanization in Huanggang Municipality in Hubei Province, the People's Republic of China (PRC) through improvements in urban environmental infrastructure and management. The project will support urban lake and river enhancement, solid waste management, and related urban environmental facilities and services. Huanggang is located in eastern Hubei Province, 78 kilometers (km) away from the provincial capital Wuhan. Huanggang is the second most populated municipality in Hubei Province with 7.46 million residents. Building on traditionally rural-based economy, Huanggang is one of the poorest municipality in the province and has relatively low urbanization rate of 35.7%. Huanggang Municipal Government (HMG), in its Twelfth Five-Year Plan (12th FYP), targets to transform its economic structure and facilitate urbanization with expanded secondary and tertiary industries. Huanggang is well positioned to take advantage of national and regional development plans. Benefiting from close proximity to Wuhan, good connectivity with neighboring cities and provinces, and rich historic, cultural and human resources, Huanggang has potential to play a strategic role in facilitating socioeconomic development in the central region of the PRC envisaged under the Central Region Development Plan and in establishing a megacity cluster around Wuhan for balanced regional development in the province. The development potential of Huanggang has been constrained by various urban development challenges. The existing central urban area is dense and cannot accommodate growing urban population and increasing economic activities. Limited urban space and inadequate urban infrastructure has slowed down economic development, which has in turn slowed down urbanization process, resulting in Huanggang lagging behind other cities and sidelined from mainstream developments in the province. The Huanggang City Master Plan (2012-2030) recognized such fundamental constraint to urban and economic development, and initiated eastward urban expansion by developing a new urban district, with adequate urban space, infrastructure and services, and environment-friendly and socially inclusive urban design to support sustainable rural-urban transition. Located in river flood plain on the north bank of the Yangtze River, Huanggang is rich in lakes and rivers. HMG, realizing the importance of water environment to the city's sustainable development, has made increasing investments in pollution source control and environment improvement. However, such efforts have been limited to the existing urban area, leaving lakes and rivers of the surrounding area unattended. The Baitan and Chiye lakes are in the center of the newly developed urban district where the government's interventions have not reached. The long neglected lakes and associated nine rivers have been ecologically and environmentally degraded. Surface water is polluted with organic matters and nutrients and is currently measured at class V or worse. The lakes and rivers are silted and blocked with polluted sediments, further degrading their water environment and ecology, weakening resilience to floods and droughts, and subsequently affecting public health and safety. The current environmental conditions of the Baitan and Chiye lakes and associated rivers limit Huanggang's ability to promote sustainable development. To address key urban development challenges in Huanggang, the project will strategically support (i) enhancement works in Baitan and Chiye lakes and associated rivers, to improve water quality, enhance flood protection, unblock the channels connecting the lakes and reestablish natural hydraulic circulation, thereby improving the retention capacity of water bodies and their resilience to climate change impacts, and restore the ecological functions of the lakes and their habitats; (ii) building of key urban infrastructure for the solid waste management system around the lakes including public awareness campaigns on solid waste sorting, reuse, recycling and safe disposal; and (iii) strengthening institutional capacity for sustainable urban development and urban management services. The creation of healthy water environment and provision of key urban infrastructure and institutional support will enhance liveability of Huanggang and allow urban expansion to support the city's sustainable development.

Regional,Regional,Economics of Climate Change in Central and West Asia,"This TA will identify priority investments for climate resilience and low-carbon growth. The TA has two components: (i) the component 'adaptation to climate change' will assess the costs and benefits of implementing adaptation measures to reduce the adverse effects of climate change on energy and water resources in the most vulnerable countries, i.e., Afghanistan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan; and (ii) the component 'mitigation of climate change' will assess the costs and benefits of GHG emission reduction measures and formulate low-carbon growth investment proposals for energy and transport in the most carbon-intensive countries in the region, i.e., Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan.The TA's impact will be climate change actions implemented in the target countries. The outcome will be a better understanding of the cost of climate change in the target countries. Each country team will tailor the methodology to the local context, while maintaining a basic standardized approach to be used across the target countries. Activities will build on national communications; the fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; and work carried out by governments, international organizations, academics, and nongovernment community-based organizations. The TA has four outputs:Output 1. The cost of climate change mitigation in energy and transport will be estimated in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan. Output 1 will assess the cost of mitigation measures and the deployment of clean energy technologies, i.e., how much it would cost to reduce GHG emissions using cost-effective clean energy technologies in the target countries under different emission scenarios. Output 1 will also assess the policy and measures needed for low-carbon growth, including market-based mechanisms, energy price setting, carbon taxation, subsidy removal, and urban planning. Through country workshops, consultation, and surveys, energy and transport emissions data will be gathered and a GHG mitigation analysis methodology defined. Output 1 will (i) develop the countries' GHG baselines and projections for two time periods up to 2050; (ii) identify GHG abatement options and targets with the use of marginal abatement cost curve analysis; and (iii) identify gaps and needs in climate policies and plans. A cost-benefit analysis of mitigation technologies and policies will be performed, including co-benefits in terms of energy security, competitiveness, and local environmental quality, to identify low-carbon growth priorities in each country. Output 1 will be supported by a capacity development program aimed at training decision makers in economic analysis of low-carbon growth measures and policy, and strengthening national systems for GHG emission monitoring, verification, and reporting.Output 2. Climate change mitigation investment opportunities will be identified in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan. Output 2 will formulate nationally appropriate mitigation actions for each country, with priority climate mitigation policies and measures in energy and transport. Options to ensure access of women and other vulnerable groups to clean energy and other mitigation measures will be considered. Climate mitigation investment proposals will be formulated in consultation with national and local stakeholders. Criteria for proposal selection will include GHG abatement potential, alignment with national development priorities, high sector demonstration value, replication and scaling-up potential, and cost effectiveness. Output 3. The cost of climate change adaptation will be estimated for Afghanistan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan. Output 3 will estimate the costs and benefits of climate change adaptation policies and technologies in energy and water resources, i.e., by how much the benefit of adaptation (avoided losses) exceeds the cost incurred. Climate change scenarios for temperature, precipitation (rain and snow), climate-induced extreme events, and other climatic parameters will be developed in Afghanistan and the Kyrgyz Republic for different time periods up to 2100 under different GHG emission scenarios to identify the likelihood of exceeding manageable thresholds. The impacts of climate change on energy and water resources will be assessed and adaptation measures identified in consultation with government and nongovernment stakeholders. The impacts of climate change on vulnerable groups such as women and the youth will be assessed. Priority adaptation measures will be identified through cost benefit analysis based on an integrated economic assessment combined with consultations and field assessments. Adaptation measures will consider different systems such as cities and river basins, as well as address the vulnerability of groups such as women and the youth. In Afghanistan and the Kyrgyz Republic, output 3 will be supported by a capacity development program aimed at: (i) training decision makers in climate scenario development, economic analysis of adaptation technologies, and policy development; and (ii) strengthening national systems for climate resilience monitoring and reporting. In Tajikistan, output 3 will focus on the economic assessment of adaptation measures and draw on ongoing work on climate scenario development and impact assessment being carried out the capacity development technical assistance Building Capacity for Climate Resilient.

People's Republic of China,East Asia,Strengthening Technical and Vocational Education and Training for Development of Priority Sectors in Shaanxi Province,"Through continued investment, the People's Republic of China (PRC) has already developed a comprehensive technical and vocational education and training (TVET) system, including a number of excellent schools that are able to adjust themselves to the demands of the market. Many teachers have demonstrated the ability to adopt new skills and competencies to help the country prepare for a growing population of capable students. However, the system faces several challenges in ensuring that TVET services keep up with the pace and scale of economic transformation. One major hurdle is how to increase efficiency and responsiveness of the TVET system. Unlike general education, the TVET subsector involves a wide range of stakeholders who provide policy directions to ensure that the skills demand is met as much as possible. As the PRC's economy continues to grow, the effectiveness of the TVET system will be measured in terms of boosting employability and work competency. To achieve this goal, efforts are being made to strengthen the linkage between the labor market and TVET. Various partnership models between schools and enterprises are starting to emerge across the country. One example is _vocational education groups_ (VEGs), which comprise both TVET schools and industrial associations and enterprises in a particularly specialized field, and provide an institutionalized platform to strengthen the linkage between the supply and demand of skilled labor.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/45069-001/main,18 Jul 2012,500000.0,0,2012,Education,No

India,South Asia,Supporting Human Capital Development in Meghalaya,"As advised by the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), Government of India, ADB is designing a loan for 'Supporting Human Capital Development in Meghalaya.' The proposed project will improve the quality and delivery of secondary education (including teacher training) and skill development programs thereby, reinforcing the efforts of the Government of Meghalaya (GoM) towards developing the state's human capital. ADB will be guided by the two flagship central programs, namely the National Skill Development Mission and the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) or the National Secondary Education Mission (and related teacher training schemes), and help to operationalize these effectively in Meghalaya. Given GoM's long-term vision and commitment, ADB will provide loan assistance to support the following outputs:(i) Meghalaya's Skill Development Mission operationalized: According to the National Skills Policy, 2009, skill development should be opened up to the private sector and decentralized to the state level. The EPC needs significant funding and capacity building support to operationalize the Meghalaya Skill Development Mission. Therefore, under this component, the proposed loan will support the following:- Expansion of the skill development infrastructure: Since most of industrial training institutes (ITIs) and polytechnics in Meghalaya are located at the headquarters of the seven districts of Meghalaya, the project will set up livelihood development centers (LDCs) in 39 Blocks to reach out to the smaller towns and villages. The LDCs will offer skilling programs based on the local natural and human resource base. Current government facilities and buildings will be upgraded into LDCs. No new construction will be undertaken. - Catalyzing outcomes-based skill development through PPPs: A ""Skills Challenge Fund"" (SCF) will be established to provide GoM with a flexible modality to draw in private sector skills providers for imparting industry-linked or demand-based training in priority areas. The SCF will also be open to government entities, industrial training institutes, and polytechnics to incentivize them to redesign and improve their own programs. The MoUs with private and public skills providers will lay down placement and quality-linked benchmarks, and funds would be released from the SCF accordingly. The project will also fund hardware and software selectively (e.g. management information systems, V-SAT links, training equipment, computers, projectors etc.) to improve the delivery and reach of skills training in priority areas. (ii) Improved learning environment in secondary schools: This project will upgrade existing secondary school buildings and teacher training centers (TTCs) which are not covered under central Government's schemes to improve learning and teaching outcomes. Majority of Meghalaya's children, especially those from poorer backgrounds, study in these schools. The upgrading will be linked to concrete reforms which will be undertaken by the schools and TTCs so that key parameters such as teacher attendance and the ratio of pupils to trained teachers improves. School Management Committees (SMCs) of the selected schools will enter into MoUs with the Department of Education committing to these reforms. ADB will not fund the construction of new buildings but only upgrade and/or reconstruct existing buildings.(iii) Strengthened capacity in relevant Departments: Technical assistance (TA) will be provided to ensure the sustainability of initiatives proposed under the project.A PPTA is required to help ADB in designing this loan.STATUS AS OF 24 MAY 2013the PPTA has been substantially completed.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/46166-002/main,30 May 2012,225000.0,0,2012,Education,No

Regional,Regional,Enhancing ADB's Engagement in Fragile and Conflict-Affected Situations,"The proposed TA aims to support ADB's FCAS developing member countries in building effective institutions that will support their peace-building and or state-building efforts. Country-led capacity development will be carried out to enable government counterparts formulate and implement strategic and operational approaches to address the challenges of fragility. The FCASs include fragile Pacific developing member countries and those in post-conflict situations such as Afghanistan and transitional Nepal, or country where there is a subnational situation of fragility like Sri Lanka. To support growth and economic development in FCAS, the proposed TA will identify peace-building and or state-building opportunities by conducting fragility assessments and formulating capacity development plans. It aims to foster new thinking to improve the use of innovative instruments and approaches in FCAS, including use of peace or fragility filters, and political economy analyses. These tools can be used to develop appropriate capacity development plans, and to better design and implement country strategies and projects. The proposed TA will contribute to an enhanced alignment with DMC governments' national development plans and state-building activities, as well as stronger harmonization with other development partners in FCAS to support the country-led efforts of transition out of fragility. The momentum thus far acquired in knowledge management in support of ADB's approach to FCAS will also be improved, bringing a deeper understanding and stronger application of innovative operational approaches into the mainstream of ADB's operations in FCAS. Building on the outputs and outcome of the previous assistance supporting ADB's engagement in fragile situations, the proposed TA will further strengthen conflict-sensitive approaches and participation, and enhance government counterparts and ADB staff capacities to conduct political economy assessments supporting development activities in FCASs. In particular, the proposed TA also intends to integrate fragility assessments and political economy analysis into the implementation of ADB's Pacific Approach. This proposed TA will build on the experiences of the ongoing TA that aims to introduce and mainstream different operational approaches to situations of fragility or post-conflict in ADB. It will benefit from the lessons learned from the pilot initiatives in Nepal and in Pacific countries. The proposed TA will identify best practices and lessons learned on conflict risk assessment under the TA on Development Partnership Program for South Asia, in particular from experiences gained in Sri Lanka. It will also benefit from the outcomes of the TA on Enhancing Engagement with Pacific Developing Member Countries and Strengthening Pacific Economic Analysis and Policy Development. A key lesson from these TAs is that further strengthening of ADB and counterpart agencies' capacity for engagement in FCASs is needed to improve development effectiveness in such fragile settings.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/45328-001/main,29 Mar 2012,800000.0,0,2012,Public sector management,No

Fiji,The Pacific,Implementing Reforms of State-Owned Enterprises,"The focus of the capacity development technical assistance (TA) is consistent with the aims of the Government of Fiji's public sector reform program and ADB's Pacific Approach 2010-2014, which accords priority to improved public sector management in the region. A TA fact-finding mission visited Fiji from 1-8 September 2011 and reached an understanding with the government and other stakeholders on the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference for consulting services.For more than a decade, Fiji has experienced low rates of economic growth, negligible job creation, and consistently high levels of poverty. The poverty incidence was estimated at 35.2% of the population in 2009, far above Fiji's Millennium Development Goal target of 14.7% by 2015. Moreover, nearly half of the population could be considered to be poor or near poor, if those with incomes near the poverty line are included. Poverty reduction challenges include high dropout rates in basic education; low participation rates in postsecondary education; a lifestyle-induced rise in noncommunicable diseases; the lack of access to clean drinking water and modern sanitation facilities by a large segment of the population; the growing numbers of families that reside in urban squatter settlements; and the low levels of expenditure on, and poor coverage of, social safety net programs. Per capita incomes in Fiji have declined steadily from 2001 to 2011. Economic growth, has averaged 0.3% per annum since 2006, which is far below what is needed to meet Fiji's poverty reduction targets.Fiji's state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are a major impediment to both economic growth and poverty reduction. The SOEs absorb scarce government funding, use capital inefficiently, raise costs, and impede effective delivery of basic infrastructure services. Low productivity of SOE investment is a significant hindrance to economic growth.SOEs make up a significant proportion of Fiji's economy - there are 29 SOEs with combined assets of $845 million dollars (22% of gross domestic product);two SOEs are in liquidation. The government's SOE portfolio represents close to 20% of Fiji's total economic assets. The average return on assets for SOEs in 2002-2009 was 0.4%, and the average return on equity was 0.8%. In 2002-2009, SOEs generated profits of just $18.6 million, which was less than the $23.6 million the government injected into loss-making SOEs. Returns on private investment in 2008 were nearly seven times higher than returns on SOE investments. More details on the status of these SOEs can be made available upon request.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/45239-001/main,02 Apr 2012,500000.0,0,2012,Public sector management,No

Lao People's Democratic Republic,South East Asia,Strengthening Capacity for Enhanced Operational Effectiveness,"The Government is systematically managing its development assistance, as required for better development results under the Paris Declaration on Aid effectiveness. The Government and 24 development partners, including ADB prepared a country action plan (CAP) to implement the Vientiane Declaration in 2007. The CAP included 40 time-bound actions under the five principles of ownership, alignment, harmonization and simplification, managing for results, and mutual accountability. ADB is closely cooperating with major bilateral and other multilateral development partners in the Lao PDR and assisting the Government in implementing the CAP. The new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) of ADB indicates that it will (i) emphasize applying regional knowledge and experience to development issues in the Lao PDR, and (ii) continue to manage, disseminate and share knowledge through seminars, workshops and meetings.  Monitoring the process of CPS implementation is a joints effort between ADB and the Government through the sector results frameworks. The annual ADB-World Bank joint country portfolio review (JCPR) with the Government will serve as an important instrument, among others, to support the CPS monitoring process. However, the current country portfolio review process needs to be strengthened to be consistent with the monitoring of outcome and output indicators reflected in sector results frameworks, and linked to the monitoring and evaluation is needed.  The 2011 JCPR confirmed the improved portfolio performance of ADB-financed operation, and however, project extension, disbursement delays and inadequate financial management remain a concern.

The S-PATA is based on the findings of a joint PPP Assessment mission fielded by ADB and Agence Fran aise de D veloppement (AFD) from 22-31 August 2011 to investigate the potential for PPPs in Cambodia. A. Impact and OutcomeThe impact of the S-PATA will be increased PPP to generate public infrastructure investments needed to accelerate Cambodia's economic growth, and to enable the leveraging of limited public sector investments in infrastructure. The outcome will be an improved enabling environment to catalyze PPP infrastructure investments in sectors such as power, water, transport, education and health sectors. This environment needs to be underpinned by strengthened institutional capacity in the public sector to develop PPPs. B. Methodology, Key Activities and RisksThe S-PATA will provide rapid and responsive assistance to enable the Government to take a more proactive role implementing its PPP program, and manage associated risks. The S-PATA outputs will be delivered in a phased manner in accordance with defined milestones and provide the basis for generating greater PPP participation. The outputs of the S-PATA will be as follows: (i) Enhanced Policy, Legal and Regulatory Framework The S-PATA will commission a strategic study for the Government on the preparation of a PPP policy, legal and regulatory framework, and outline institutional arrangements that reflects international standards and best practices. (ii) Institutional Arrangements for PPPs Refined and PPP Preparation Process Developed The S-PATA will review options and develop the basic outline of a model institutional structure that would reflect international best practice and meet the needs of Cambodia for the development and implementation of PPP projects. Effective institutional arrangements are one of the key factors that define a country's success implementing a PPP program. The two critical agencies that need to be developed by the Government are a PPP Unit and a Risk Management Unit (RMU). A PPP Unit is a centralized agency that acts as a source and custodian of standardized PPP contractual structures and project screening, preparation, transaction, and management processes. The PPP Unit disseminates this information to prospective GCAs at the national and/or sub-national level considering the development of a PPP project, and provides technical assistance and oversight of project quality. A RMU is a centralized agency that provides approval to GCAs to provide government support needed to make projects _bankable_, while ensuring they are affordable to the Government, and the projects generate value for money (VFM). The provision of government support by the Government creates both direct and contingent liabilities (risks), and these need to be managed in the context of the Government's overall portfolio of liabilities.(iii) Increase Understanding and Awareness of the PPP Project Lifecycle. Workshops will be held under the S-PATA to increase the awareness within key ministries, and line agencies responsible for PPPs in Cambodia. The workshops will help prospective GCAs gain an understanding of the requirements to develop, implement and manage PPP contracts. These workshops will help generate stakeholder support for PPPs in Cambodia. (iv) A Pipeline of Bankable Projects Identified to be Developed Through a Project Development Facility (PDF). The S-PATA will recommend the appropriate structure, level of resources, and operational arrangements for a PDF. The PDF is a mechanism that enables prospective GCAs to source funds to cover a portion of PPP project preparation and transaction costs, thereby reducing the impact of PPP procurement costs on their budgets. A well designed PDF will increase the quality and quantity of _bankable_ PPP projects that are offered to the market. Strong political commitment is required to catalyze private sector investments through PPP for infrastructure development. The Government needs to take a range of actions to strengthen the enabling environment, develop consensus among different government ministries/agencies and other stakeholders, develop appropriate incentives for private sector participation through government support, and provide effective fiscal risk management arrangements. Risks for the S-PATA include lack of political will to promote and invite private sector participation through PPPs; delays in approval and implementation of policy, legal and regulatory arrangements; inadequate institutional capacity and ability to access resources; and difficulties identifying bankable infrastructure projects.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/45424-001/main,16 Dec 2011,225000.0,0,2011,Public sector management,No

Regional,Regional,Support for Regional Multisector Investment Framework for Greater Mekong Subregion Development (Phase 1),"The GMS countries straddle a dynamic region between large and fast growing economies in East Asia and South Asia, and it is easy to project economic activity of several trillions of dollars in the expanded region within the next decade, as indicated by the Asia 2050 study. Growth nodes of today may be surpassed by new centers catering to the increasing trade flows accompanying the high levels of economic activity. Both conceptually and operationally, now is a good time to do a regional investment framework and plan for the GMS building on existing knowledge and based on current trends and medium-term forecasts in regional economic activity, including trade and urban development. The regional investment framework can ensure that increased channeling of resources in corridor development through widening and deepening is based on comprehensive economic and technical analysis from the start, including good cost-benefit assessment. Given the scale and scope of investments necessary, it is also important to suitably incorporate environmental dimensions of the investments early on using a regional framework. This is consistent with the increasing and repeated emphasis of member countries on the need to address environment and climate change as part of the new GMS SF, and to emphasize green development approaches. The regional investment framework can also serve as the launch pad for discussing higher-level cooperation in the GMS program in its third decade, including increased regional cross-border investments. A comprehensive regional planning approach would be a substantial exercise comprising seven steps, namely: (i) diagnosis, (ii) macro-framework building, (iii) sectoral planning, (iv) intersectoral coordination, (v) plan finalization, (vi) action program formulation and (vii) planning for implementation. To enhance its manageability while also promoting flexibility, it is proposed to undertake this task in two phases, with the first phase focusing on thorough diagnostics, analytical studies, and formulation of a macro framework along with initial elements of sectoral planning, including needed institutional elements.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/45326-001/main,15 Dec 2011,1500000.0,0,2011,"Agriculture, natural resources and rural development",No

Regional,Regional,Improving Agricultural and Rural Statistics for Food Security,"The Global Strategy to Improve Agricultural and Rural Statistics (hereafter Global Strategy) that was endorsed by the United Nations Statistics Commission provides a framework to enable national and international statistical systems to produce and apply the basic data and information needed to guide decision making for food security and development in the 21st century. The Global Strategy responds to the growing need for sustainable statistical systems that provide reliable and accurate data on agricultural and rural sectors that are comparable across time and country. These are indispensable for evidence-based policy on poverty reduction, reduced food price volatility and sustainable use of natural resources (especially in light of climate change) in Asia and the Pacific. The Global Strategy has three pillars: (i) the establishment of a minimum set of core data that countries will collect to meet current and emerging demands; (ii) the integration of agriculture into national statistical systems in order to satisfy the demands of policy makers and other users who rely on comparable data across locations and time; and (iii) the foundation that will ensure sustainability of the agricultural statistics systems through governance and statistical capacity building.The pillars of the Global Strategy are consistent with the approach of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in using evidence-based policy making for improving development outcomes. The outputs of the Global Strategy support ADB's strategic agenda of inclusive growth. As a major partner of governments in promoting inclusive growth, it is recommended that ADB should actively participate in the implementation of the Global Strategy in Asia and the Pacific. ADB should influence the major stakeholders in (i) developing a workable implementation plan in the region, (ii) enjoining countries to include the agricultural and rural statistics in monitoring their development plans through policy dialogues; and (iii) undertaking methodological research to develop a cost-effective and reliable data collection strategy for agricultural and rural statistics that can be adopted by countries in Asia and the Pacific.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/45261-001/main,13 Dec 2011,500000.0,0,2011,"Agriculture, natural resources and rural development",Yes

The CDS approach combines the well-known growth diagnostics framework developed by Hausmann, Rodrik and Velasco with the Diagnostic Framework for Inclusiveness that has been added by ADB to ensure sufficient focus on poverty, inequality, employment and other aspects of socio-economic inclusion. The TA will develop the labor market aspects of the CDS approach and then apply it in four countries.Considerable analysis of the labor market and the education and training sector has been undertaken by various organizations in the two countries specified under this TA. ADB and other agencies, such as the ILO, have recently completed or have on-going projects in the areas of education, including technical vocational education and training (TVET) and labor market information. Furthermore, two recently approved TAs in the Regional Sustainable Development Department focus on various aspects of green jobs, gender, skills and labor markets. The TA will build on and complement the research, analysis and activities that have been undertaken to date, and generate synergies with the two recently approved TAs.A specific focus of the TA will be on the flow of information between and amongst employers, jobseekers, youth entering post-basic education, labor market policy planners in government, and the education system, including education and training institutes. The information flows will be mapped and key stakeholders surveyed to determine bottlenecks that inhibit proper private and public planning for employment and skills. In conducting the analysis, the research will take into account structural change, patterns of investment that shape employment demand, the flow of individuals between rural and urban areas, and the nature of formal versus informal employment. As appropriate, the analysis may also draw on data from existing household and labor market surveys conducted by national statistics offices or other agencies, where such data is relevant and timely. In conducting the analysis and data gathering, distinctions will be made based on gender and socio-economic status (poor/non-poor, etc.) and on other relevant criteria where possible and as appropriate to the analysis.The TA will have two main components: (i) in-depth country assessments, as outlined above; and (ii) broad dissemination of the key findings and recommendations, principally through discussion at a national forum with policymakers and other stakeholders. The results of the analysis will be used as inputs to the CDS for Cambodia and Viet Nam which are scheduled for preparation in 2012 and for two additional CDS in 2013. This phased approach will allow insights from the two initial studies under this TA to inform the detailed design and scope of the two latter studies, ensuring that learning takes place over the course of the TA.

Viet Nam,South East Asia,Productive Rural Infrastructure Development Project in the Central Highlands,"The proposed project (Project) aims to rehabilitate and upgrade existing but deteriorated productive rural infrastructure (PRI) in five central highland provinces (CHP) of Gia Lai, Kon Tum, Dac Lak, Dac Nong and Lam Dong over a period of seven years. It directly supports the Government of Viet Nam's (Government) National Target Program for New Rural Development (NRD). The PRI has deteriorated because of limited funding available for new investment and a constrained capacity to sustainably develop, manage and use the assets. This contributes to CHP's poverty by constraining rural productivity. The Project would focus on sustainably improving approximately 30 medium scale irrigation systems, and associated PRI including: rural access infrastructure; and, local markets. In consultation with the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD), the 30 subprojects would be selected from CHP's Socio-Economic Development Plans. The improved PRI is expected to enable communities to respond to market signals by: increasing agricultural intensity and diversity; providing quicker and safer access to markets, employment opportunities, and social services; and, reducing costs of rural production and marketing, as well as reducing food wastage. Improved PRI increases incomes from both on- and off-farm employment, decreases the burden of chores on women, and increases food availability even when yields are constant. This is pro-poor and will be increasingly important for climate change resilience (CCR). The Project advances two key, Government supported innovations. The first innovation enhances PRI sustainability and includes good practice, which has previously not been systematically implemented by: (i) concentrating a critical mass of PRI investments in selected productive areas; (ii) having the communities prioritize the PRI improvements in and around the selected irrigation schemes; (iii) preparing PRI condition inventories and a program to update them; (iv) using whole asset life analysis with realistic maintenance assumptions as the basis for design and sustainable management; (v) improving trails and paths within the irrigation systems thus separating pedestrians and cyclists who are often women and children from motorized traffic and reducing the loss of productive land; and (vi) incorporating bio-engineering for soil and water conservation in the design thus stabilizing the local ecosystems and improving CCR. The second innovation is multi-level capacity building measures (CBM) that are gender sensitive to assist stakeholders (owners, managers and users) to sustainably develop, manage and use PRI. The CBM will have three key components: (i) Preparation of a long-term capacity building strategy; (ii) Strengthening local capacity to manage the PRI improved by the Project; and (iii) Building the local knowledge base for sustainable PRI development. CBM activities would include opportunities for: (i) PRI stakeholder training; (ii) upgrading PRI related qualifications of CHP officials; (iii) research of PRI knowledge gaps; and (iv) Work experience for agriculture and engineering students. Each CBM level, including technical and managerial content, will ensure good practices used by stakeholders are fully consistent with each other and institutionalized in formal and non-formal training courses and academic curricula.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/40238-012/main,09 Feb 2012,1000000.0,0,2012,"Agriculture, natural resources and rural development",Yes

India,South Asia,MFF - Second India Infrastructure Project Financing Facility (IIPFF II) - PFR3,"The executing agency for the Second India Infrastructure Project Financing Facility (IIPFF II), the India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited (IIFCL), requested ADB to approve the Tranche III (Periodic Financing Request [PFR]3) of IIPFF II for $240 million to finance 7 indicative new subprojects in addition to the disbursement balance left for 5 existing subprojects approved under Tranches I and II. The total cost of the 7 subprojects is estimated at Rs140.18 billion (or $2.92 billion), inclusive of taxes, duties, and interest and other charges on the loan during construction, against which IIFCL sanctioned Rs15.2 billion (or $316.27 million). The PFR3 is expected to catalyze 12 times of funding resources from the market. The requested loan of $240 million will be from ADB's ordinary capital resources under ADB's LIBOR-based lending facility with a 0.15% commitment charge and a 25-year term including grace period of 5 years, and such other terms agreed in the FFA and under the loan agreement.

The indicative 7 subprojects under the proposed PFR3 were selected based on commercial and technical viability in compliance with relevant national and ADB norms. The tranche's loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). IIFCL requested retroactive financing for the PFR3. Except as otherwise agreed with ADB, it is proposed that the total eligible expenditure under retroactive financing will not exceed an amount equivalent to 20% of the individual loan and must have been incurred not more than 12 months before signing of the related legal agreements.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/41036-043/main,24 Apr 2012,240000000.0,0,2012,Finance,No
Cambodia,South East Asia,Third Financial Sector Program - Subprogram 1,"The sequence of financial reforms in Cambodia has been guided by the Government's 10-year FSDS. A project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) for $850,000 ($700,000 from ADB TASF IV) was approved in April 2010 to help the Government update the FSDS 2006-2015 and formulate the next cluster program. IMF and World Bank have recently completed the first financial sector assessment program (FSAP) on Cambodia that will provide useful inputs to the update of the 10-year FSDS. While FSP I has been rated successful by the independent evaluation department (IED), some of the reform measures were not widely enforced due to weak interministerial coordination and capacity constraint. Prepared within the framework of the updated FSDS, the next program cluster (FSP III) will help complete some of the reform programs that commenced during FSP II, strengthen the enforcement of completed activities, and commence reform activities in leasing, capital market, and pension fund. The expected overall impact of the cluster program is a sound, market-based finance sector to enhance mobilization of financial resources to support sustainable economic growth. The expected outcome of the FSP III is a growing, resilient, and efficient financial system. FSP III is expected to be approved in November 2011. The National Bank of Cambodia will be the Executing Agency, and the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) and Ministry of Commerce (MOC) will be the Implementing Agencies.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/42305-013/main,08 Feb 2012,14740000.0,0,2012,Finance,No

Indonesia,South East Asia,Regional Roads Development Project,"The proposed Project will improve strategic national road corridors in northern Kalimantan and southern Java to support economic growth in these two less developed and poorer areas of Indonesia. The rehabilitation, capacity expansion and new construction of highways will strengthen national and regional connectivity, and improve access to markets, job opportunities and social services in four provinces. The national road network in southern Java is incomplete, with some road sections of the southern Trans Java Highway not yet constructed resulting in gaps in network coverage; other sections are constructed below national standards and in poor condition. Improved road infrastructure in southern Java is necessary for removing existing constraints to economic growth and investment in this isolated area. Similarly, road network improvements are needed to support economic development in the less developed and remote districts in northern Kalimantan. Improved road connections in Kalimantan to the border will also support the Brunei Indonesia Malaysia Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA) transport initiatives to develop two land-based transport corridors for greater connectivity and reduced transport costs and complement other BIMP-EAGA programs to reduce non-physical barriers to trade by improving customs, immigration, quarantine and security processes. Recognizing the need to protect and preserve the environmentally sensitive areas of Kalimantan, the proposed project will not support any road improvements in this area.",Closed,http://www.adb.org/projects/38479-034/main,03 Jul 2012,159960000.0,0,2012,Transport,No
