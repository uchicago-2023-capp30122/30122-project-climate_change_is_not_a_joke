<p>
The 2015 Paris Agreement (ratified on Nov 2016) on climate change was a historic step forward in the global effort to combat the impacts of climate change. Multilateral development banks (MDBs) have an important role to play in supporting the implementation of the Paris Agreement, specifically in the Asia Pacific region, which is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. MDBs have a critical role to play in providing financial and technical assistance to developing countries to support the implementation of the Paris Agreement. The goal of this project is to conduct a comparative analysis of the funding patterns of major MDBs in the Asia Pacific region after the Paris Agreement.

The dashboad has six parts:
</p>

<p><b>1. Interactive Map</b> -shows the summarized information per country. Details will be shown when user hovers through the map on the right. Filters on the left side allow user to view different cuts metrics based on data source and the time interval (pre/post Paris Agreement) </p>

<p><b>2. Regression Plots</b> -examine the effects of the Paris Agrement on Climate related project investments. Detailed Statisical analysis results can be found in the StatResults file</p>
